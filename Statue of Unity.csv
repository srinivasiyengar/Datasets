"Tribals from the town of Kevadia in Gujarat were up in protest, marking Saturday as a “black day” against the Statue of Unity project, made to commemorate the legacy of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.Even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the statue today, the tribal leadership and activists faced pre-emptive arrests with internet services remaining suspended in some parts. In addition to launching 17 new projects, Modi launched a sea-plane service from Kevadia in Gujarat’s Narmada district to the Sabarmati riverfront. The district remains among the poorest and most marginalised in the state.Tribal families across villages in Kevadia have been protesting against the alleged forced land acquisition and displacement caused by the Rs 3,000-crore statue. To many, it remains a colossal waste of public funds, a gimmick which has adversely affected as many as 75,000 people.Accompanied by Chief Minister Vijay Rupani and Governor Acharya Devvrat, the Prime Minister reportedly indulged in games at the Children’s Nutrition Park, cruised in a jetty along the six-kilometre navigation channel down the Narmada River and petted animals and birds at the Sardar Patel Kevadia Zoological Park. The homes of the tribals were destroyed for this land.Speaking to NewsClick, a Kevadia resident, on the condition of anonymity said: “This is our land, we were told to leave and find our way, only for such indulgences.” Since its formation, the district has had no government hospital with modern amenities and intensive care unit facility. Last year, villagers from across 72 villages did not cook food in their homes for three days to register their protests against the project and observed a complete shutdown. Eight tribal leaders, including Praful Vasava and Krishna Kant, were detained in a bid to maintain “peace” in the area.Speaking to NewsClick, tribal leader Chhotubhai Vasava said: “The government is trying to market this and sell it as a tourism project; they are turning a blind eye to the suffering of many people who have lost their traditional land holdings and the brazen violations of the constitutional provisions that have taken place because of this project. The price of tickets is extremely high and people are finally realising that this was not about tribals or tourism but a project for massive loot.”On the day of its inauguration two years ago, 300 tribal activists were detained and eventually released. Activists on the ground say that the suppression has only become worse.NewsClick had previously reported on villagers in the area who had threatened to immolate themselves over land acquisition by the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL).Then, Praful Vasava had told NewsClick that the “government has been aggressively acquiring land for projects. Tribals have been arrested for entering their own land, their tractors or other agricultural equipment have been seized for farming. Tribals have been farming these lands for years. Without their land, they don’t have an alternate source of income. When the Statue of Unity was to be built, the government told us that it will bring jobs for the tribals. But nobody has got employment; instead, their source of livelihood is being taken away,” he added.The Statue of Unity stands tall due to CSR funds from cash-strapped PSUs. A CAG report tabled in Parliament on August 7, 2018, brought out serious irregularities in the use of social responsibility funds by the PSUs under the administrative control of the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas (MPNG).","Statue of Unity: Tribal Activists Arrested Ahead of PM Modi’s Visit, Mobile Services Suspended in Parts",Pre-Construction
"Natwar Tadvi, a 55-year-old villager from Kevadiya village, with a can of kerosene in hand, threatened to immolate himself while joining the ongoing protests against land acquisition by the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd. (SSNNL) in Gujarat. Tadvi is one of many tribal people residing in villages around the Statue of Unity in Kevadiya colony, Narmada district. The tribal people have been protesting against the acquisition of their land for the statue and other projects surrounding it.For the past one month, the people of these villages have been protesting against the fencing of land by the SSNNL. The latter claims that the land had been acquired for the Narmada Dam project over six years ago, but it had not taken possession of it.“If the land on which we farm is fenced, we will have no means of livelihood,” said Tadvi.Tadvi was arrested after police personnel, who were deployed at the site of protest, stopped him and took away the can containing kerosene from him.We have detained him and have initiated a Chapter Case proceeding against him as part of preventive action under the CrPC,” said Vani Doodhat, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Kevadiya.Fresh protests came up in early May, when SSNNL began work on the fencing of the open plot of land around the Statue of Unity located at Sadhu Bet, Kevadiya Colony. The tribal people of the land, which covers six villages surrounding the statue – Navagam, Limbdi, Kevadiya, Kothi, Gora and Vagahadiya, rose in protest. Last week, the protestors clashed with local police after SSNNL officials began fencing the land. About 20 of them were arrested.On June 5, after a month of protest, the fencing work was stopped to facilitate talks with the locals.While the Gujarat government has claimed that the fencing has nothing to do with the Statue of Unity, the locals hold that the fencing was yet another ploy to acquire their land for tourism-related projects around the Statue of Unity.“We have laid fences only on open plots of SSNNL. No one has been asked to vacate, even if they are living inside a fenced plot. We have covered a number of plots through this exercise till now. However, we stopped work to initiate a dialogue with the tribals and make them aware about the government packages,” said Nikunj Parikh, Deputy Collector of Kevadiya.Notably, the SSNNL has announced a relocation plan for the displaced families, and agreed to allot commercial shops to affected beneficiaries, among other compensatory measures.However, the villagers maintain that the project which began with the construction of the statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel at Kevadiya, will displace at least 5,000 tribal people who live close to the statue.SSNNL began the construction of the fence and the process of acquiring the disputed land in May, after the Gujarat High Court gave permission. Earlier, the High Court had stayed the process, after a PIL was filed which challenged the government’s claim on the land.Ahmedabad-based environmentalist, Mahesh Pandya, had filed the PIL in the Gujarat High Court in 2019, against the land acquisition in six villages around the Statue of Unity.“The Gujarat government and the SSNNL are set to evict more than 5,000 tribals under the guise of tourism development projects, without following due process under the Land Acquisition Act. The authorities are acquiring the land by claiming that it had been acquired in the 1960s. They say that since there was no possession and no need for the land, people were allowed to settle there,” Pandya’s PIL stated.“Today, the same land is being used for Sreshtha Bharat Bhavan and tourism related projects, in gross violation of due process under Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Resettlement and Rehabilitation Act,” said Praful Vasava, a tribal-rights activist and member of Boter Gam Adivasi Samaj.","tribals Protest Against Land Acquisition by SSNNL, Villager Threatens Self-Immolation",Post-Construction
"Narendra Modi is all set to visit Gujarat for the one-year anniversary of the Statue of Unity on October 31. Ahead of his visit, tribals are upping their ante against the government to seek attention to the land grab issue and the loss of livelihood that has taken place in the state because of the statue.With tribals comprising about 85% of the population of the district, it is by far one of the poorest districts of Gujarat. Since its formation, the district has had no government hospital with modern amenities and intensive care unit facility. In all, 72 villages of Narmada district and about 75,000 tribals are affected by the Statue of Unity project, Shreshtha Bharat Bhawan, Valley of Flowers and the four-lane road leading uphill to Sadhu Bet—the spot where the project is located in Kevadiya.Displaced villagers from 19 villages—who were originally recognised as ‘project-affected’ and promised rehabilitation aid of Rs 5 lakh or a new plot of land—are still awaiting compensation. Six villages—Navagam, Kevadiya, Gora, Kothi, Limdi and Waghariya—have not been formally declared as project-affected. However, about 90% of the land of Kevadiya village has been grabbed for widening of the road. In Gora, Kothi and Limdi, about 25% of the land has been unofficially grabbed after allegedly offering verbal promises of rehabilitation. This apart, 28 villages on the bank of the main canal of the Narmada river have not been allowed to use water for their parched land, which most of the tribal farmers are struggling to cultivate in a rain-scarce year.Highlighting these issues, the tribals, along with former Gujarat Chief Minister Suresh Mehta, said at a press conference that the BJP government in the state has also backtracked on its promise to provide jobs or alternate land to project-affected people. Speaking to NewsClick, Arun Mehta of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), said, “The tribals have been raising these concerns for a long time now. Their livelihoods have been completely overlooked by the state, even the new hotels that the government is planning are harming the business of the local traders.”The state High Court had previously ordered status quo in the matter. The 72 villages around Garudeshwar taluka near the Sardar Sarovar Dam are covered by Schedule-V and therefore are subject to PESA (Panchyats Extension to Scheduled Area) Act, where the government cannot do anything without the consent of the gram sabhas (village-level administrative unit). Yet, tribal farmers, animals, life and livelihood have been dislocated, said the press statement released during the conference.“The government had promised them compensation and alternative employment. They were promised training to be tourist guides, for housekeeping, security and attendants. It was promised that for every tribal losing land, seven would get a job. However, that has not happened,” the statement said. Previously, the tribals had protested by not cooking for days ahead of the inauguration of the project.NewsClick had also reported on how the 182-metre-tall Statue of Unity is standing tall on the misused social funds from the cash-strapped PSUs. A CAG (Comptroller and Auditor General of India) report tabled in the Parliament on August 7, 2018 had brought out serious irregularities in the use of social responsibility funds by the PSUs under the administrative control of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MPNG). According to the report, five PSUs—Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited, Indian Oil Corporation Limited and Oil India Limited—had contributed Rs 146.83 crore together (ONGC: Rs 50 crore, IOCL: Rs 21.83 crore, BPCL, HPCL, OIL: Rs 25 crore each) towards the construction of the Statue of Unity. The funding came from their expenditure earmarked for corporate social responsibility (CSR). In addition, 14 PSUs from Gujarat also seem to have spent Rs 104.88 crore under CSR for the same project.",Statue of Unity: Tribals From 72 Villages Protests Ahead of Modi’s Visit,Post-Construction
"Gujarat government has come up with a proposal to acquire more land belonging to tribal villagers of villages around Sadhu bet island, on which Sardar Patel’s Statue of Unity stands in Narmada district of Gujarat. Reportedly, the land is said to be acquired in order to accommodate hotels, safari park, 33 state bhavans and other recreational extravaganza around the statue that is said to affect about 5,000 tribals from six villages. A PIL was filed in the Gujarat High Court opposing the proposal of the state government by Gujarat-based activist Mahesh Pandya.The PIL stated, “The government wants to displace tribals to build hotels, a tiger safari, 33 state bhavans etc. The land acquisition proceedings for the land in question has already lapsed as per section 24(2) of the new land acquisition law passed in 2013, as neither the possession was taken by the government nor any compensation was paid to the affected people.” The division bench of acting Chief Justice AS Dave and Justice Biren Vaishnav has issued notices to state government, district revenue officer and Sardar Sraovar Nigam Limited (SSNL), while halting the process of land acquisition till further notice. The proposal came in the backdrop of an ongoing protest by tribals of villages whose land has already been acquired earlier for the statue, a flower garden and the four-lane road leading to the statue. About 75,000 tribals from 72 villages around the project have been directly or indirectly affected by whole project. Six villages – Navagam, Waghariya, Limdi, Kothi and Gora and Kevadiya, immediately around Sadhu Bet – have been badly affected due to the project. While Kevadiya has lost about 90% of its land to the project, Waghariya has lost all its land. Out of the population of about 1,500 of Waghariya village, 15 displaced families were rehabilitated in mud huts in an area with no basic amenities like drinking water or electricity. Rest of the residents are being pushed to accept land far away from their homes. Notably, the villagers of Kevadiya were displaced just a week before the inauguration of the Statue of Unity when road to Sadhu Bet was being widened from two lanes to four. Villagers protesting the eviction were reportedly met with indiscriminate lathi charge by the police and villagers including men and women were detained for 24 hours. The villagers -- who now reside on a rocky patch of land -- had returned to find that their homes had been demolished overnight. Of the 72 villages affected due to the statue, rehabilitation has been left midway in 32 villages. In seven villages in Garudeshwar block, cash compensation has been given, but villages are yet to get a commitment from the authorities for land or jobs. This apart, there are six villages whose land was acquired for the staff colonies of Sardar Sarovar employees, but they were never recognised as ‘affected by the project’. “These villagers are fighting to be recognised as ‘affected by the project’,” said Praful Vasava, a tribal leader who has been in the forefront of the protests. “The locals were never taken into confidence before building such a massive project. We have been losing land since the inception of Sardar Dam. How many times will the government change the landscape around this area and keep acquiring land from these villages?” questioned a tribal villager. ",Gujarat HC Stays Land Acquisition Around Sardar Patel Statue,Post-Construction
"Touted as the tallest in the world at a height of 182 feet, the Statue of Unity- the tribute to Sardar Patel- which was built post protests from the poorest districts in the state of Narmada and the alleged use of funds from the Public Sector Undertakings, is back in the spotlight over the non-payment of workers employed in its maintenance.Over 100 employees at the site have reportedly not been paid for the past three months and are now resorting to a strike this week to draw the attention of the apathetic state government. The employees, who work for a company named Updater Services Ltd (UDS), including security guards, gardeners, sweepers, liftmen, ticket checkers, are dependent purely on their daily wages.Speaking to NewsClick, Arun Mehta from the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) in Gujarat, said, “The workers are employed under a private company, which was to be given grants by the state government. The pending wages include about Rs. 8,000-10,000 per month and some supervisors whose salaries are amounting to Rs. 14,000 and perhaps more. These workers have not been paid for the past approximately four months. Currently, they are resorting to demonstrations and they even formed a human chain to draw the attention of the government. They cannot resort to any aggressive protests, given the fact they are contractual workers.”On one hand, the state government has been trying to project sky rocketing profits for the statue and on the other, it has been unable to provide minimum wages to the employees maintaining it. Union tourism minister KJ Alphons in a parliamentary reply had claimed that the “revenue generated from visitors to Statue of Unity from November 2018 to January 2019 is Rs.19.47 crore,” and “the number of tourists who visited the Statue of Unity at Kevadia in three months from November 2018 to January 2019 was 7,81,349 as against an yearly average of 8,22,009 tourists visiting Sardar Sarovar Dam at Kevadia in the last five years.”Responding to this, Mehta added, “This is sheer hypocrisy on the part of the government. Meanwhile, the non-payment of salaries has left the workers with no alternative.”The Rs 2,989 crore project inaugurated on October 31, 2018, has faced heavy criticism from the tribals in Narmada district. Previously, the villagers had shown black balloons and had protested ardently against Narendra Modi at the time of inauguration of the statue.","Statue of Unity Workers Not Paid, Resort to Strike",Post-Construction
"The 182-metre-tall statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel or the Statue of Unity is standing tall on the misused social funds from the cash-strapped PSUs. A CAG (Comptroller and Auditor General of India) report tabled in the Parliament on August 7, 2018 has brought out serious irregularities in the use of social responsibility funds by the PSUs under the administrative control of Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas (MPNG).According to the report, five PSUs – Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited, Indian Oil Corporation Limited and Oil India Limited – had contributed Rs 146.83 crore together (ONGC: Rs 50 crore, IOCL: Rs 21.83 crore, BPCL, HPCL, OIL: Rs 25 crore each) towards the construction of Statue of Unity. The funding came from their expenditure earmarked for corporate social responsibility (CSR). In addition, 14 PSUs from Gujarat also seem to have spent Rs 104.88 crores under CSR for the same project.Interestingly, the enormous expenditure incurred by the companies in the name of CSR does not meet with the specifications listed in the Companies Act.Activities which may be included by companies in their CSR policy are as under:(i)  Activities relating to eradicating extreme hunger, poverty and malnutrition, promoting health care including preventive health care and sanitation (including contribution to the Swachh Bharat Kosh set-up by the Central Government for the promotion of sanitation) and making available safe drinking water;(ii)  promoting education, including special education and employment enhancing vocation skills especially among children, women, elderly, and the differently-abled and livelihood enhancement projects;(iii)  promoting gender equality, empowering women, setting up homes and hostels for women and orphans; setting up old age homes, day care centres and such other facilities for senior citizens and measures for reducing inequalities faced by socially and economically backward groups;(iv)  ensuring environmental sustainability, ecological balance, protection of flora and fauna, animal welfare, agro-forestry, conservation of natural resources and maintaining quality of soil, air and water (including contribution to the Clean Ganga Fund set-up by the Central Government for rejuvenation of river Ganga);(v)  protection of national heritage, alt and culture including restoration of buildings and sites of historical importance and works of art; setting up public libraries; promotion and development of traditional and handicrafts:(vi)  measures for the benefit of armed forces veterans, war widows and their dependents;(vii)  training to promote rural sports, nationally recognized sports, paralympic sports and Olympic sports;(viii)  contribution to the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund or any other fund set up by the Central Government for socio-economic development and relief and welfare of the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes, other backward classes, minorities and women;(ix)  contributions or funds provided to technology incubators located within academic institutions which are approved by the Central Government;(x)  rural development projects; and(xi)  slum area development. Reportedly, the already cash-strapped PSUs were under enormous pressure from both the central and the state governments to contribute funds towards the construction of the statue. Speaking to Newsclick, E A S Sarma, former secretary to the GOI said, “Sardar Patel's contribution to the unity of India is, no doubt, immeasurable, but he himself would not have endorsed such a huge expenditure of public funds for constructing his statue. As pointed out by the CAG, it was highly irregular on the part of the concerned PSUs to incur such expenditure under CSR, as envisaged under Section 135 of the Companies Act. It is surprising that neither the audit committee of any of these PSUs, nor the independent directors, nor the other directors have cared to question such irregular expenditure, apparently in fear of reprisals from those in authority.”The arm-twisting of the PSUs by the government becomes evident in the complete breakdown in the procedures of the corporate governance of the 19 PSUs referred above. Procedurally, the audit committees could have used their power to prevent the respective managements from succumbing to the diktats of the Modi government. However, this was not done. Under Section 149 of the Companies Act, the independent directors are required to safeguard the interests of the shareholders, but they failed in doing so, in this case.ONGC justified the contribution by stating that the project included activities such as promotion of education, and development of banks of river Narmada. The Management of BPCL, HPCL and IOCL stated in their reply to the CAG that as per circular no. 21/2014 issued by MCA, they interpreted the activity liberally to capture the essence of the subjects enumerated in the Schedule VII of Companies Act 2013. Responding to this, the government auditor made it explicitly clear that the contribution to 'Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust (SVPRET)' for Gujarat government's ‘Statue of Unity’ project cannot pass off as a contribution towards a project aimed at protecting national heritage, art and culture (an approved CSR activity as per schedule VII of the Companies Act 2013), as it was not a heritage asset. The on the PSU’s was being built from the past few months. An agenda note which was approved by the chairman and the managing director, and ratified by the ONGC board in April, mentioned that Oil & Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Indian Oil Corp (IOC) will contribute Rs 50 crore each out of its CSR funds. Other profit-making public sector undertakings (PSUs) were reportedly directed to pay Rs 25 crore each. Instructions were also given by the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, in March 2017, to all oil and gas companies to support the project in “a collaborative mode”.  The CAG report exposes the pattern of weakening the public sector by the Modi government. The nature of arm-twisting of the PSU’s and the impunity with which the public funds were diverted for the statue invite serious objections.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs is now in the spotlight, as pressure is being built on the ministry to order a probe ensuring deterrent action against concerned PSU managements as well as the audit committees and independent directors.",Statue of Unity: CSR Funds from Several PSUs Diverted for Construction,Post-Construction
"Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s unveiling of the “tallest statue in the world” has been accompanied by a high-voltage campaign on Sardar Patel’s contribution to nation-building. Of course, we know -- and Modi has made it repeatedly clear -- that this recognition of Patel is a part of the campaign to dismantle the legacy of Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of the country. In the game of opposing pairs of icons, sometimes it is Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose versus Nehru; sometimes, Babasaheb Ambedkar versus Nehru; and often, Patel versus Nehru. Nehru remains the constant enemy for Modi and the RSS-BJP.Why is Nehru the constant enemy? As Prime Minister, Nehru embodied the vision of the national movement: a secular state as the instrument of development for lifting Indian people out of poverty. This was the central impulse of  the independence movement against the British. These two elements – secularism and development -- distinguish all the leaders of the national movement, whether Patel, Bose, Ambedkar, Nehru or others, from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). For the RSS, the British were not the enemies; the nationalists, secularists and the Muslims were.The RSS is the only political formation that wanted an India based on religious identity; it had nothing to say about development either. For RSS, Indian and foreign capital should develop the Indian economy, with the state only playing the role of a facilitator. This is similar to what Modi has managed in the Rafale deal. It is such a vision of the state in the RSS ideology that kept the RSS and its allied movements out of the independence struggle. And this is why the secular institutions of the state and the public sector are seen as key enemies by the RSS-BJP today. These are the institutions that need to be dismantled, along with Jawaharlal Nehru.The “Unity” Statue of Patel has been built at a cost of Rs 2,989 crore. As Dhirubhai Patel, the 91-year-old grandnephew of Sardar Patel, has said, Patel would not have approved of this statue. He knew the value of money. Sardar Patel has been often quoted on his priorities for India: “I have one wish: that India becomes a productive nation; no one should cry for food and remain hungry.” Patel would certainly not have approved of wasting Rs 2,989 crore on a statue which will produce nothing but dubious vainglory for Prime Minister Modi.A number of people have made calculations to list more productive uses of  this amount of money. Or with the money our most travelled PM has spent on his frequent foreign tours. Prime ministers are “allowed” their vanity expenditures. We pay a much higher price when we procure Rafale aircraft at eight billion euros, and that too without any technology transfers, and indigenous development. And we might have to “compensate” the US now for daring to buy Russian S-400 missile defence systems, by procuring US made, outmoded F16s at an even higher price. So, perhaps, we should overlook the “small” price tag of about $400 million for the 182-metre, world’s tallest statue!A Monument for the Indian EliteConsider, instead, who this magnificent monument been built for; and who has paid the price for it. If we look at the website of this Statue of Unity, it is clear it is meant for the Indian elite, who can stay in an opulent Hotel (a part of the statue complex), and look at the Sardar Sarovar Lake. The website states, “...two guest-room levels above a public floor containing meal services, a ballroom, and other meeting and event spaces. King rooms and suites are located on the river side of the building, where they have access to balconies overlooking generous gardens.”Further, “A heavy-load open lift with a panoramic view will be built alongside the Statue of Unity. Visitors will be able to rise up within statue, walk into a viewing gallery and enjoy a panoramic view of the Sardar Sarovar project and the surrounding region from an astounding height of close to 400ft.” In other words, this statue is a monument to the Indian elite, who can come, look at a beautiful lake, rise without any effort to a height of 400 feet and have a panoramic view of the surroundings. It is about elite “consumption” of nature.You know what you don’t see from 400 feet? People. Nor do we see them when you look at the lake that has submerged 377 square kilometres of land.What is missing in this picture of development? The people who have paid for the statue and the lake that has submerged their homes and lands. The people Patel talked about when he envisioned a productive nation.It is always true that the poorest pay the most in development projects involving dams and mines. Their lands are taken away, the compensation is either not given, or meagre; they have no alternative livelihood. The gains are for capital, who make money out of the projects, then enjoy the continued benefits. The landed peasantry and big landowners benefit from the irrigation provided downstream. Even the electricity from the power house of hydro-electric projects do not reach the villages nearby, only towns and industries far away. This is how capital views development and that is how it operates under capitalism.Tribals Badly Hit and DisplacedThe Narmada Dams – Sardar Sarovar and Indira Sagar -- are no different. The tribal villages that have been displaced for the dams, are yet to receive water or electricity; the affected people their full compensation. The villagers near Sardar Sarovar say that 28 villages near the Sardar Sarovar Dam are yet to receive water. 72 tribal villages kept a day’s fast on October 31, the day Modi inaugurated the statue. There have been widespread protests by the tribals in the area. Posters of Modi and Rupani have been blackened, requiring police protection for posters!The “Unity” Statue has fared no better. The heads of 22 villages wrote an open letter to the PM, saying that they would not welcome him for the inauguration. They wrote, “These forests, rivers, waterfalls, land and agriculture supported us for generations. We survived on them. But, everything is being destroyed now and celebrations are also planned. Don’t you think it’s akin to celebrating someone’s death? We feel so.” So much for Modi’s unity.It also appears that there were other issues with the statue project. The relevant environmental clearances were not taken, nor the villagers consulted, as the law requires for such projects.Modi’s statue project brings to mind the relationship between monumental architecture and the fascist imagination. From ancient rulers to modern “strongmen”, they all seem to be fascinated by size. And let us also understand Patel’s attraction for Modi: if Patel was the Iron Man of 20th century India, Modi wants to be his 21st century version. This is as much statue of himself as it is of Patel’s.History knows how to deal with such vainglory. Shelley,  the English romantic revolutionary poet, wrote about the remains of a mighty statue:And on the pedestal these words appear:""My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!""Nothing beside remains: round the decayOf that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,The lone and level sands stretch far awayStatues rise and fall, Mr. Modi, only the people remain.","Statues Rise and Fall, Mr Modi, Only the People Remain",Post-Construction
"Narmada district was formed in 1997 out of Dediyapada, Nandod and Saghbara talukas carved out of Bharuch district and Tilakwada taluka carved out of Vadodara district. With tribals dominating about 85% of the population of the district, it is by far one of the poorest districts of Gujarat.Since its formation, the district has had no government hospital with modern amenities and intensive care unit facility. Severe cases of illness or accidents are referred to Vadodara, a district about 90 kilometres away from Narmada. Reportedly, the only blood bank of the district was formed two years ago.Picture the contrast when the 182-feet tall Sardar Patel statue named ‘Statue of Unity’, touted to be the ‘tallest’ in the world, was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Kevadiya, about 30 kilometres from Rajpipla, district headquarter of Narmada on October 31. The area was milling with more than 4,000 police personnel with one Additional Director General of Police, one Inspector General, five Superintendents of Police and more than 30 Deputy Superintendent of Police, as thousands of tribals protested throughout the district.“A district where tribals worry about the availability of ambulance on the right time because there is no proper road has been chosen to be the location for Rs 3,000 crore project. Tribals, whose villages have no roads, are losing their land for construction of the four-lane road to the ‘Statue of Unity’,” Praful Vasava, tribal leader of the district told Newsclick.“Why is this district not being developed first? Instead, the government is grabbing the tribal land that falls under Schedule Area Act without the permission of gram panchayats,” he added.Bandh ObservedOn Wednesday, while cameras flashed as PM Modi arrived with a battery of VIPs, the Rajpipla market bore a deserted look as shops remained shut observing a bandh as a mark of protest. Black balloons were flown in the air and tyres burnt to generate black smoke as the event unfolded.“The shopkeepers of the Rajpipla had been threatened by the local police after they put up notices declaring a bandh call on October 31st,” Vasava said.According to villagers, the police had begun detaining people since the evening of October 30, by brazenly knocking on random doors of  tribal homes and picking up people without stating. Ninety activists who had arrived in solidarity with the movement of the tribals have been detained. These included Rohit Prajapati, Nita Mahadev, Mudita Vidrohi, Virji Viradiya, Amar Singh Choudhary, Anand Mazgaonkar and Lakhanbhai. Nita Mahadev and her daughter Mudita were forcibly brought back to Ahmedabad with only male police accompanying them.Vasava, local tribal leader who had called the bandh and was leading the protest, was detained on October 31 while flashing a placard stating “Narendra Modi go back” written with his blood.“In all likelihood, the police will be deployed at every household of villages around the statue,” said Lakhanbhai, an activist working amongst the tribals, who was also detained.Rehabilitation Promises BeliedIn all, 72 villages of Narmada district and about 75,000 tribals are affected by ‘Statue of Unity’ project, Sresth Bhawans, valley of flowers and the four-lane road leading uphill to Sadhu Bet, the spot where the project is located in Kevadiya. Displaced villagers from the 19 villages that were originally recognised as ‘project affected’ and promised rehabilitation aid of Rs 5 lakh or a new plot of land, are still waiting with bated breath.Six villages – Navagam, Kevadiya, Gora, Kothi, Limdi and Waghariya -- have not been formally declared as ‘project affected’. However, about 90% of the land of Kevadiya village has been grabbed for widening of the road, land of Navagam and Waghariya is gradually getting submerged as dam water is released and water rises in the weir. In Gora, Kothi and Limdi, about 25% of the land has been unofficially grabbed after offering verbal promises of rehabilitation.This apart, 28 villages on the bank of the main canal of the Narmada river have not been allowed to use water for their parched land, which most of the tribal farmers are struggling to cultivate in a rain-scarce year.Rajpipla and markets of neighbouring areas remained closed observing bandh as a mark of protest “A week ago, tribals of Kevadiya village were lathi-charged and detained and their homes were demolished before they were released,” says Govindbhai, sarpanch of Waghariya village that has lost all its land to the project.“Some women were injured in the lathi charge. Their land is being taken for Sreshtha Bharat Bhawan,” he added.Earlier, sarpanchs of 22 gram panchayats in Narmada district had written an open letter to Modi urging him to skip the inauguration ceremony, as he wouldn’t be welcomed in ‘their land’ in Kevadiya colony.“While the tribals of the district are struggling to avail basic amenities like hospitals, schools and drinking water, you decide to spend crores of money on construction of a statue and additional money again for an inaugural ceremony. With a heavy heart we, the villagers, are telling you that we will not welcome you on our land in our district,” read the letters signed by the sarpanchs.‘It’s a Fight For Survival’“We are not against Sardar Patel, we just want our land back or at least proper rehabilitation,” says Ambaben, who had first lost her land when Sardar Sarovar dam was built and remaining land is gradually getting submerged as water fills in the weir of the Narmada.Tyres were burnt to generate smoke as sign of protest“Before the dam was built, the land around the villages used to be fertile three-crop land. We never used any fertiliser as floods every year would bring in fertile silt. When the dam was built they took our three-crop land and the promised rehabilitation never arrived. Whatever we cultivated and whatever land remained with our family, where we have already cultivated vegetables, is getting submerged with the crop,” adds 60-year-old Ambaben, former sarpanch of Limdi group gram panchayat.  “The tribals are fighting against the issue for more than 40 years now. It has been easy to fool tribals who are not educated and register a legal case. But now they are fighting back as this is not just a fight for the land but our culture and survival,” adds Lakhanbhai.","Tribal Protests, Black Balloons Cloud Modi’s Unveiling of ‘Statue of Unity’",Pre-Construction
"About 500 metres from the nearly Rs 3,000 crore ‘Statue of Unity’ in Narmada district, stand five huts. One of them is the abode of Ambaben Poonabhai, a 60-year-old woman who was once sarpanch of Limdi group gram panchayat of Limdi and Navagam villages.Navagam is one of those villages where land will be submerged as water rises in the weir of Narmada river. As the ‘Statue of Unity’ is set to inaugurated on October 31, water from the dam has been released in the weir for the VIPs and guests to witness a river full of water. (A weir is a barrier across the horizontal width of a river that alters the flow characteristics of water and usually results in a change in the height of the river level)“About 40 acres of land in Navagam will be submerged till October 31. Farmers had cultivated vegetables which are almost ready. Nobody told us that water is being released from the dam. We are witnessing the water level rise by the hour and land submerging gradually,” Ambaben told Newsclick.“Farmers are frantically working in the fields trying to salvage what they can,” adds Ambaben, who waits along with other tribal residents of Navagam as their land submerges gradually.“A family owns between 2-4 acres of land. There are poor tribal families who sustain themselves on crops and vegetables they grow on their small patch of land. Now that the land will be submerged, most of them will have no means of feeding themselves or their family,” says Sanjay Tadvi, son of Ambaben, and a resident of Navagam.About 500 metres from the nearly Rs 3,000 crore ‘Statue of Unity’ in Narmada district, stand five huts. One of them is the abode of Ambaben Poonabhai, a 60-year-old woman who was once sarpanch of Limdi group gram panchayat of Limdi and Navagam villages.In ruins stands remains of a home of a tribal family of 12, demolished a week back to widen the road to Statue of Unity. Location- Waghariya village, about 1 km from Statue of Unity“We have already lost a major portion of our land when the road to Sardar Sarovar dam was being built. The Gujarat government promised us 5 acres per family and jobs for whoever is above 18 years of age. But neither were we allotted any piece of land nor did we get any job. We have submitted memorandums and letters to the district authorities to the office of Chief Minister in Gandhinagar, but in vain. After a long silence, they told us, the project missed counting us in the victim list, and assured that our names shall be included when the weir is built. Instead of being rehabilitated, we lost our portion of  the remaining land acquired for widening the road to the ‘Statue of Unity’, and remaining shall drown as the water level rises in the weir,” adds Sanjay, who works as a labourer in Kevadiya Colony that fetches him Rs 200 a day.Six villages – Navagam, Waghariya, Limdi, Kevadiya, Kothi and Gora -- immediately around the Sadhu Bet, the location of the ‘Statue of Unity’ are badly affected. Of these, Waghariya has lost all of its land, while Kevadiya village has lost about 90% of land.Noticeably, villagers of Kevadiya were displaced just a week ago when the road to Sadhu Bet was being widened from two lanes to four lanes. Amidst strong protests, the police lathi-charged indiscriminately injuring even women and detained the villagers for 24 hours. When the villagers returned  to the village after their release, every house along the road had been demolished. The residents of Kevadiya have now settled a kilometre away amid a rocky patch of land. Sarojben, who led the protest and a few others are under constant police watch and refused to speak on the issue.Police Presence Prior to Inauguration“By the evening of October 30, police personnel will be deployed in front of every household around the villages surrounding Sadhu Bet, barring locals from stepping out of their homes,” Lakhanbhai, an activist working with tribals of the area, told Newsclick.“This is how the locals are restricted from freely moving in their own land every time a VIP visits the area,” he adds.“The water pipeline and several handpumps in the area have been demolished while widening the road. Six villages of the area have no means of drinking water. When we approached the district authorities, they turned a blind eye. Later Larsen and Toubro (L&T), the company that is working on the project, arranged for water to be delivered by tankers of its own accord. The tankers deliver water twice a day to those living by the side of the road. But villagers whose houses were demolished and have been pushed away from the road have no access to the tanker water. This has been the situation for a month now,” says Govind Bhai Tadvi, sarpanch of Waghariya village.“Besides the amount of water that each family is getting through tanker isn’t enough,” he adds.All the residents of Waghariya have been displaced due to  the project of ‘Statue of Unity’. Out of an entire village that had an population of about 1,500, 15 displaced families have been rehabilitated in mud huts in an area with no amenities like electricity or drinking water. The rest of them are being pushed to accept land very far away from their homes.“Our family was offered a housing plot in Pansoli village near Dabhoi, about 60 kilometres from our house, and the land for cultivation was allotted at Tel Taalav, about 10 kilometres away from the housing plot. How can a farmer travel 10 kilometre to cultivate his field every day?” shares Govindbhai.“We refused to accept land at such a distance from our original home. Later, we were offered Rs 5 lakh, but we refused that too as the market value of the land my family owns is more than Rs 1 crore,” adds Govindbhai.“Six acres of land that our family still owns at the bank of the weir will be submerged in two days. I don’t think we can salvage all of the cotton we have cultivated,” he says,  pointing towards several sacks of cotton stacked up in his house, the crop that he could salvage so far.‘We Will Not Leave Our Land’The villagers resent being dumped to the fringes without being consulted even once.“The locals were never taken into confidence or told that such a huge scale of tourist place shall be built on and around their homes. The tribals of the area have been losing their land since the inception of the Sardar Sarovar dam. Now they have built such a massive statue, valley of flowers and Bharat Sreshth Bhawan (guest house of every state) is to come up along with it. Does the government ever think on whose land are they building the projects? The locals here solely depend on agriculture. If their land is snatched how will they survive. We will not leave our land,” says Lakhanbhai.A protest and bandh have been called in the district by Praful Vasava, a local tribal leader. About 100 tribal organisations of 15 tribal-dominated districts of Gujarat have supported the cause. The tribals have been tearing off the posters of the project featuring Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani.Massive police force has been deployed in Narmada district viewing the resistance from the tribals. Noticeably, police personnel have also been deployed to protect the posters.“About 85% of the population of Narmada district are tribals. The land in the district is protected under the Fifth Cchedule. As per law, if land is to be acquired, the gram sabha has to agree to give it away. But while building the Narmada weir dam or ‘Statue of Unity’, the Gujarat government did not bother to take permission of the gram sabha of respective villages. Land from 13 villages have been acquired for the weir dam. Tribals of these villages have neither received money or land elsewhere in lieu of their land lost to the dam,” Vasava said.“In total 72 villages and 75,000 tribal villagers have been affected by the project of ‘Statue of Unity’. The government is destroying our homes, land and culture It is a fight of jal, jungle, zameen (water, forest and land),” adds Vasava, who apprehends he shall be detained by the evening of October 30.",The Tall Price That Gujarat's Tribals Are Paying for the 'Tallest' Statue,Pre-Construction
"Ahmedabad: Posters depicting Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's 'Statue of Unity' were being torn or blackened by tribals who oppose the unveiling of the statue in Gujarat's Narmada district, an official said on Saturday. Across the district, 90% of the posters depicting Modi, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani and of the event were being either torn or blackened. ""This is clearly a sign of how the tribal community is dissenting against the BJP. They have taken away our land, the most valuable resource a tribal has, to carry out the so called development,"" said Prafull Vasava, a tribal leader.  ""The authorities have replaced the torn posters with new ones and kept them guarded by the police. This might be the first time anywhere in the world that even posters of a Prime Minister have to be guarded by the police. ""Tribal communities from Narmada have been opposing this project since 2010, but now the entire tribal belt in the state is against it,"" he added. Around 75,000 tribals affected by the 'Statue of Unity' project are expected to oppose the unveiling slated for October 31 by staging a bandh. Some 100 small and big tribal organisations across the state have backed the bandh.  ""Right from Banaskantha to the Dang district, nine tribal districts will be joining us in the agitation. And the 'Bandh' will not only be limited to schools, offices or commercial establishments, but households will be observing a 'fast' (no cooking),"" Vasava said. ""No food will be cooked in 72 villages affected by the entire project, as we will be mourning the project which is being carried out for our destruction,"" added Vasava.  According to tradition, food is not cooked in a tribal village when they mourn the dead. ""Our rights as tribals are being violated by the government. We don't have anything against the great son of Gujarat, Sardar Patel and his honour should be maintained. We are not against the development even, but this project is against us,"" added Vasava. Located in the mountain range of Satpura and Vindhyanchal, about 100 km from Vadodara, the world's tallest statue will be inaugurated by Modi on October 31, marking the 143rd birth anniversary of Sardar Patel.","Posters on Modi, Statue of Unity Torn, Blackened by Protesting Tribals",Pre-Construction

This massive statue is of the Iron Man of India – Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. It is a tribute to his immense contribution, dedication, and determination towards our nation. It helps the coming generations know about his role in uniting India.Who is Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel?Sardar Patel was the first deputy Prime Minister as well as the Home Minister of Independent India. He played a very crucial role in the freedom movement as well as post-independence. At the time, when India got independence, India was comprised of 562 different princely states of all kinds. Sardar Patel took responsibility on his shoulders to unite and bring all of these scattered princely states together to form one nation.Statue of Unity – Sardar Vallabhbhai PatelDuring the freedom movement too, he dedicated himself to many movements like Disobedience, Quit India Movement, etc. to free India from the British.Statue of Unity at Kevadia, Gujarat – An Engineering MarvelMagical hands of Padma Shri and Padma Bhusan awardee Ram V. Sutar Ji designed the giant statue. It is made up of approximately 70,000 tonnes of cement, 18,500 tonnes of reinforcement steel, and 6000 tonnes of structural steel. More than 3000 workers and 200 engineers worked day and night to build this spectacular statue.Landscape view of Sardar Patel statueThe Statue of Unity with a height of 182 meters towers the previous tallest statue Spring Temple Buddha (153M) in China.

It was inaugurated on 31st October 2018 on the 143rd birth anniversary of Sardar Patel by the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi.Unique Loha CampaignLoha is Iron in Hindi and Sanskrit. Sardar Patel is known as ‘Lauh Purush’ or the Iron Man of India for his iron will that led to a United India. To commemorate this, a unique Loha campaign was launched across the country. An appeal was made to the farmers and villagers of this country to donate their used iron tools and soil. These would go in the making of the monument. This campaign received huge support and more than 1,69,000 kits were received.Visiting the Statue of Unity, Kevadia, GujaratI got the opportunity to visit this place last December and literally the visit was worth it.

"Sardar Patel Statue of Unity is Narendra Modi’s political vanity project.India will now have the tallest statue in the world, and it is the Sardar Patel Statue of Unity. It will add to the symbolic and rhetorical pride that Indians like to revel in these days.If you are one of those people who think this will bring loads of pride and millions of foreign tourists to our country, let me ask you one question: Which was the tallest statue in the world till now?If you said Statue of Liberty, you’re wrong. You are one of the many people in the world who have no idea where the tallest statue is. And, this really goes on to show how valuable an achievement the Sardar Patel Statue of Unity is. By the way, the tallest statue in the world was the Spring Temple Buddha in China. But don’t be embarrassed if you have never heard of it. It is never even listed in the top 10 tourist attractions in China. The Great Wall, the Terracotta Army and the Forbidden City are the top three tourist attractions in China. Guess what’s common between them? They are all historical and cultural wonders.Across the world, historical monuments and sites are a far better tourist magnet than any modern construction. That is why the Eiffel Tower gets almost 7 million tourists every year compared to Dubai’s Burj Khalifa, which gets 2 million tourists despite being the tallest building in the world.There’s no reason to believe why the Statue of Unity would attract more tourists than India’s top historical wonders like Taj Mahal or Amber fort. It is another matter that BJP MLA Sangeet Som tried his best to denigrate Taj Mahal for his politics.The Sardar Patel statue is about political symbolism, and does not add to India’s rich culture and history. Our country is, in fact, overflowing with historical and cultural monuments but we hardly have the money to preserve them. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has over 3600+ monuments under its custody, including 36 world heritage sites. It has to reach out to the private sector to adopt the monuments. In fact, ASI spent more money to build its new headquarters than it did on conservation of the monuments in 2017.Moreover, only 116 monuments have entry tickets, which can earn revenue. Upgrading services at these monuments, including at the Taj Mahal, would give tourism a better boost than spending Rs 3,000 crore on one political statue.Economically, this statue makes no sense either. The Taj Mahal is the most visited tourist attraction in India, which earns an annual revenue of Rs 25 crore from 8 million tourists. It would be optimistic to hope that the Sardar Patel Statue of Unity will get even a tenth of that number. But even if we assume that the Statue of Unity becomes as popular as the Taj Mahal, it would take more than 120 years to just break even. Add to that the maintenance cost, and it probably will never even become profitable. One can argue that visitor centres, museums and restaurants would help generate revenue but how much of that money will end up in government treasury?The entire Sardar Patel statue project costs approximately $430 million (Rs 3,000 crore). Of which, the cost of just the statue (182 metres) is nearly $200 million (Rs 1,347 crore). The Spring Temple Buddha statue had cost $18 million (128 metre). Even with inflation, it is unfathomable why it is 10 times higher here.Thousands of tribals will hold a mass protest against the statue because their lands were taken away. The statue is also made with the help of Chinese workers. With so many question marks on the Statue of Unity, all we have is the justification of political benefit.But this isn’t be the first time Indian politicians have indulged in political vanity projects of building statues – albeit not at this scale.In the 1990s, Andhra Pradesh chief minister N.T. Rama Rao dreamed of a tall 440-tonne granite Buddha statue in the Hussain Sagar Lake. He was inspired by his visit to New York’s Statue of Liberty. But even before the statue was installed, it fell off the barge that was transporting it and lay flat in the waters for long, causing him much grief.Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan also inaugurated a tall statue of Raja Bhoj along the Bhopal lake – obstructing the view for many residents. At the inauguration ceremony, Chouhan said he will try to bring back Bhoj’s goddess’ statue, ‘Vagdevi’, from the British Museum.Modi only took this trend a notch above everyone else and, in his characteristic style, aimed for it to be the world’s tallest statue. Ask yourself this: If Iron Man Sardar Patel was alive today, what would be his response to this gigantic blunder?","Even if Statue of Unity becomes as famous as Taj Mahal, we may need 120 years to break even",Pre-Construction

It was built within three-and-a-half years by an army of over 3,000 workers, including 300 engineers from infrastructure major Larsen & Toubro (L&T).4. As Gujarat chief minister, Modi had announced the project in 2010 ahead of civic elections in Ahmedabad. The project, which cost Rs 3,050 crore, was fully funded by the Gujarat government.5. The Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust (SVPRET), a special purpose vehicle set up by Modi in 2011, arranged some 129 tonnes of iron implements from nearly 100 million farmers in 169,000 villages across all states to construct the base of the statue in the 'Loha' campaign.6. The Statue of Unity was built by Padma Bhushan recipient sculptor Ram V Sutar and intricate bronze cladding work was done by a Chinese foundry, the Jiangxi Toqine Company (JTQ).7. The viewing gallery for the statue, at 153 metres, can accommodate 200 people at a time and offer an expansive view of the Sardar Sarovar Dam.9. The statue is a three-layered structure. The innermost layer is made of reinforced cement concrete (RCC), comprising two towers 127 metres high that rise till the statue's chest. The second layer is a steel structure and the third an 8 mm bronze cladding on the surface.10. The RCC towers, which at the bottom form Patel's dhoti-clad legs, have two lifts each. Each lift can carry 26 people to the top in just above half a minute.While some foreign media are reporting the Statue of Unity as a mark of India's growing prosperity, the project has faced stiff opposition from tribals.They said that their lands were taken away for the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Project, near which is the statue site, as well as for the statue and all other tourism activities which have been planned. Gujarat tribal organisations said that as many as 75,000 tribals, adversely affected by the Statue of Unity, will observe a bandh today. The bandh will not only be limited to schools, offices or commercial establishments, but households will also be silent (no cooking).However, officials claim that nearly 15,000 direct jobs will be generated for the tribal people every year from the project.The Modi government has also drawn flak for spending a staggering amount on the project, while the farmers in the country continue to perish and tribals protest.

"The Statue of Unity, built in the fond memory of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and inaugurated by PM Narendra Modi in Kevadia, Gujarat the previous year, is once again in news. With a towering height of 182 meters, it is acclaimed to be the world’s tallest statue. On October 31 this year, soon after the statue completed the first anniversary of its grand inauguration, the social media sites have been flooded with misleading posts on how much it earned in terms of revenue and is being compared with the Taj Mahal. The misleading information claims that the revenue earned through the Statue of unity since its inauguration is thrice than that of what Taj Mahal earned annually between 2016-19 i.e., three years period.The Claims Made Taj Mahal earned Rs 22.3 crores in last three years while Statue of Unity earned Rs 71.6 crore in just one year since inauguration. While Taj Mahal had 7.5 lakh visitors every year, the Statue of Unity had 26 lakh visitors till October 31, 2019. Fact Check Revenue from The Taj Mahal According to the data released by the Lok Sabha, Taj Mahal witnessed around 68 lakh tourists in 2018-19, almost nine times of 7.5 lakh tourists being claimed by fake posts. Revenue earned by Taj Mahal was 77 crores. And the total annual average revenue generated from the monument in the last three years is approximately 61.4 crores, not Rs 22.3 crores. Thus, the government data goes totally against the false information being shared. Tourist inflow and revenue from centrally protected ticket during 2018-19 The number of visitors in 2017-18 was 64.7 lakh and the revenue earned through selling ticket was 56.5 crore. Tourist inflow and revenue from centrally protected ticket during 2017-18 The number of visitors in 2017-18 was 60 lakh and the revenue earned through selling ticket was 49.67 crore. Tourist inflow and revenue from centrally protected ticket during 2016-17 Revenue From the Statue of Unity As far as the Statue of Unity figures are concerned, according to the website of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Trust some over 28 lakh visitors have visited the statue since its inauguration, which generated annual revenue of Rs 80.65 crore. Source: Statue Of Unity/Twitter Another reports released by The Times of India confirms this data related to its total revenue generation So, posts claiming that the Statue of Unity collected thrice the revenue as compared to the annual average revenue of Taj Mahal is totally baseless. Also, as the ticket fare of both these monuments are different their revenues cannot be compared just like that. While the entry fees of Taj Mahal for Indian citizen is Rs 50 per person with charges varying for foreign tourists. The ticket cost of Statue of Unity is more than double with Rs 120 per ticket. In conclusion, the claim that the Statue of Unity earned thrice the average annual revenue of Taj Mahal is false and misleading. Rs 80.65 crore generated by Statue of Unity is definitely not the thrice amount of Rs 61.4 crore, which is the average annual revenue of Taj Mahal for the last three years.",Fact Check: Did The Statue Of Unity Really Earn Thrice As Much As The Taj Mahal?,Post-Construction

Even if we consider more footfalls on weekends and in the tourist season, it can safely assume an annual tourist traffic of 6 million in the first year and a 10 percent increase every passing year, still, it will take at least three decades to reach a breakeven.The Statue of Unity is open to the public on all days of the week. Tourists would have to pay Rs 350 per person to the best view of the monument where a high-speed elevator takes you to a height of about 400 feet close to the chest of the Sardar Patel statue.There is also a regular entry ticket which is priced at Rs 120 per person. We have assumed that 30 percent of the tourist would opt for observation deck ticket, while the rest of the tourists taking the regular entry.We have also taken into the account that a quarter of their annual earnings will be spent in maintaining this mammoth statue and its premise. We have also, considered an Rs 10 revision in the ticket price, every second year.Having said that, these are just calculations based on some assumptions and the actual break-even might happen a bit earlier or a little longer. But was it worth spending Rs 3,000 crores which is equal to the cost of building two new Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) campuses, five Indian Institute of Management (IIM) campuses and six Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) missions to Mars or could have been utilised in any other development projects? ","Statue of Unity' built at a cost of Rs 3,000 crore: Here's how many years it will take to break even",Post-Construction

However, the petitioner claimed that the villagers retained the possession of the land as the authorities had never used it. He argued that original acquisition had already lapsed and for the last 58 years the land had remained with the Adivasis.“Though the respondents [government and SSNNL] have large tracts of unused land at all such villages, they want these tribals to shift elsewhere,” the petition read. “Once the acquisition has lapsed, the respondents have no right, title, or interest in the land in question.”AdvertisementLarge-scale displacementThe Statue of Unity is in Kevadia, a few kilometres downstream from the Sardar Sarovar Dam that has already displaced more than two lakh people in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra.

The statue was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 31, 2018, on the 143rd birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.On 15th December 2013, a marathon entitled “Run For Unity” was held in Surat and in Vadodara to support the project.The world’s tallest “Statue of Unity” is a pride of India and a decent honor to the fearless who undivided and integrated India, our precious Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. He was highly respected for his leadership in uniting the 552 states of India to form the single Union of India.About Design:After studying several statues of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel across the country, a team of historians, artists, and academics choose to proceed with a design submitted by the Indian sculptor, Ram V. Sutar. The expression, posture and pose justify the dignity, confidence, iron will, and kindness that his personality expel. Three models of the design measuring 3 feet, 18 feet, and 30 feet were created at the beginning. Once the design of the largest model was approved, a detailed 3D-scan was designed which model the basis for the bronze cladding cast in a workshop in China.About Construction: India’s leading infrastructure company L&T won the contract on 27 October 2014 for its lowest bid of Rs 2,989 crore equivalent to Rs 36 billion in 2018 for the design, construction, and maintenance. They initiated the construction on 31 October 2014. In phase-1 of the project, Rs 1,347 crore was spent for the main statue, Rs 235 crore spent for the exhibition hall and convention center, Rs 83 crore spent for the bridge connecting the memorial to the mainland and Rs 657 crore spent for the maintenance of the structure for 15 years after its completion. As per the L&T official, they have employed over 3000 workers and 250 engineers for the construction of the statue. The foundation of the statue utilized 210,000 cubic meters of cement concrete, 6500 tonnes of structural steel, and 18500 tonnes of thickened steel. The outer part together with 1700 tonnes of bronze plates and 1850 tonnes of bronze surrounding which in turn include 565 macro and 6000 micro panels. The total height of the structure is 240 m (790 ft), with a base of 58 m (190 ft) and the statue of 182 m (597 ft). The height of 182 was specially chosen to match the number of seats in the Gujarat Legislative Assembly. The statue is built in a way that can stand up against winds of up to 180 km/hour and earthquakes measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale which is at a depth of 10 km and within a radius of 12 km of the statue. It took 57 months to complete, 15 months for planning, 40 months for construction and two months for handing over by the consortium. To make sure seamless execution of the whole project, an independent society named Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust (SVPRET) has been established under the Chairmanship of Chief Minister, Government of Gujarat.About Funding:The total cost of the project was estimated to be about Rs 2,063 crore equivalent to Rs 25 billion in 2018 by the government. The tender bids for phase-1 were invited in October 2013 and were closed in November 2013. This statue was built by the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model. Most of the money allocated by Gujarat Govt i.e. Rs 500 crore for the project in the budget from 2012-2015. Rs 239 crore was also allocated in the 2014-15 Union Budget for the construction of the statue. Funds were also shared by the Public Sector Undertakings under the Corporate Social Responsibility scheme.Issues faced during the construction:Local tribals belonging to the Tadvi caste against land acquisition for the construction of tourism infrastructure nearby the statue. Although, they have been offered cash, land compensation, and provided jobs. People of nearby villages such as Kevadia, Kothi, Waghodia, Limbdi, Navagam, and Gora against the construction of the statue and claimed the refund of the land rights over 375 hectares (927 acres) of land obtained earlier for the construction of the dam as well as the constitution of new Garudeshwar subdistrict. They also disagree with the development of the Kevadia Area Development Authority (KADA) and the construction of the Garudeshwar weir-cum-causeway project. At last, the government of Gujarat has to accept their demands.About Tourism: The Gujarat government has made every effort to develop the entire neighborhood as a world-class tourist center. As it is double in height of world-famous New York’s Statue of Liberty. The Statue of Unity is fair to draw numbers of foreign tourists along with domestic visitors across India. The statue’s location is its important features. The beautiful scenic surroundings of the Satpura and Vindhyachal hills along with the heroic river Narmada give the perfect view to the statue, which is built on an Island. The viewers’ gallery inside the statue is a prime attraction at the site located at the height of 135 with a capacity to accommodate 200 persons at a time. There are also high-speed lifts installed and are capable of taking 5,000 people per day to the viewing gallery, which offers a breathtaking sight of the surrounding areas. There are numerous other tourist attractions around apart from the Statue of Unity including the valley of flowers, natural beauty of the Satpura and Vindhyachal hill ranges. The Gujarat government newly opened a luxurious nature sanctuary, Tent City Narmada, just 10 minutes away from the monument. On 1st November 2018, over 1,28,000 tourists visited the Statue of Unity in 11 days after it was opened to the public. At the same time, over 1.9 million visitors in 9 months were visited. It is expected that this tallest statue will generate around 15,000 direct jobs in tourism.Proposed and Planned Infra:As of now, there are several projects in the card to assure that this place turns out to be a popular tourist point. A world-class zoo will be developed across 1,300 acres over seven levels by the name Sardar Patel Zoological Park near the statue. Moreover, there is a plan to start boating activities near the statue as a jetty is being constructed in the Narmada.Recent News on Statue of Unity:The day before yesterday, PM Modi urges people to visit Sardar Sarovar Dam and its nearby the Statue Of Unity in his home state Gujarat that has touched historic 134-meter water levels. After setting a number of records, the Statue of Unity in Gujarat has found a place in the Time’s list of 100 greatest places in the world. It is a matter of pride that the Statue of Unity is emerging as a popular tourist destination and at the same time, a record 34,000 people visited the site in a single day.On 18th August 2019, Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani inaugurated a river rafting sports facility at Khalvani near the Statue of Unity.This statue is known as the Pride of the Nation, but the mass of people think that spending Rs. 2900 crores on it have been completely wastage of public money. Several questions have been asked In the recent govt exams.What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Statue of Unity?Advantages of Statue of UnityIt is the world’s tallest statue which has recently been awarded in Time’s list of 100 greatest places in the world, is located in India and considered to be ‘Pride of Nation’.It will boost income from tourism and generate a large number of hotels, transports and other services.Increase in the transport, restaurants, accommodation, service sectors.It is estimated that this statue will remain as it is for 1000 years which implies that it will contribute to the national income of India through tourism for centuries.Local people getting employment.The local business has seen lots of progress.Disadvantages of Statue of UnityThe government has spent a huge amount of money on this project over other priorities like women’s safety, education and agriculture schemes.There are plenty of sectors in India, like health, safety, employment and education where the money could have been utilized.Many political parties allege that this was a place of religious significance, so it should not be built on the land.Was it worth spending a huge amount on the Statue of Unity?If I start writing whether the Statue of Unity worth or not, it will go on and on but I hope this little and fair idea of why building this statue is a step in the right direction. It will lead to a lot of new employment opportunities every year and PM Modi has promised that thousands of young generation will get employment through this project. It’s not just about Inda’s pride of building the tallest statue but it’s about creating employment and revenue for the country. At the same time, it will create new business opportunities for the people living in nearby areas. Local businesses have been seen in lots of progress. Earlier nearer restaurants used to remain profitable only during monsoon while dam overflowing. Increase in the transport, restaurants, accommodation, and service sectors. This reversely will improve the economy of India. Living in a developing country we always aim to think of everything from the perspective of giving everything to poor people, but that does not help after 76 years of Independence. As per a report, 480 million people are still under poverty like in India. If the government just donated these Rs 2989 cr in their bank accounts, they would have got peanuts. That’s not a decent amount to give them. Also, when was the last time giving free money helped the poor get out of poverty? Employing more n more people will simply take out people from poverty. This is just one project. The government has lots of projects in place to help the poor offering education, medical facilities, toilets, and housing facilities. How is it fair to say that projects like these should not be undertaken and instead the money should again be used for education and other purposes? If we do that, we will never come out of that wrong period.For the development of the nation, we need to change our mindset and start thinking of initiatives like these from a different angle not from the angle of politics.",Key information: The Statue of Unity,Post-Construction
"India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi will today inaugurate the world’s largest statue, the Statue of Unity in Gujarat. At 182m tall (240m including the base), it is twice the height of the Statue of Liberty, and depicts India’s first deputy Prime Minister, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. The statue overlooks the Sardar Sarovar Dam on the Narmada River. Patel is often thought of as the inspiration for the dam, which came to international attention when the World Bank withdraw its support from the project in 1993 after a decade of environmental and humanitarian protests. It wasn’t until 2013 that the World Bank funded another large dam project.    Like the dam, the statue has been condemned for its lack of environmental oversight, and its displacement of local Adivasi or indigenous people. The land on which the statue was built is an Adivasi sacred site that was taken forcibly from them. The Statue of Unity is part of a broader push by Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to promote Patel as a symbol of Indian nationalism and free-market development. The statue’s website praises him for bringing the princely states into the Union of India and for being an early advocate of Indian free enterprise.    The BJP’s promotion of Patel also serves to overshadow the legacy of his boss, India’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. Nehru’s descendants head India’s most influential opposition party, the Indian National Congress.    The statue was supposed to be built with both private and public money, but it attracted little private investment. In the end, the government of Gujarat paid for much of the statue’s US$416.67 million price tag.    The Gujarat government claims its investment in the statue will promote tourism, and that tourism is “sustainable development”. The United Nations says that sustainable tourism increases environmental outcomes and promotes local cultures. But given the statue’s lack of environmental checks and its displacement of local populations, it is hard to see how this project fulfils these goals.    The structure itself is not exactly a model of sustainable design. Some 5,000 tonnes of iron, 75,000 cubic metres of concrete, 5,700 tonnes of steel, and 22,500 tonnes of bronze sheets were used in its construction.    Critics of the statue note that this emblem of Indian nationalism was designed by a Chinese architect, and the bronze sheeting was put in place by Chinese labour.    The statue’s position next to the controversial Sardar Sarovar Dam is also telling. While chief minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014, Modi pushed for the dam’s construction despite the World Bank’s condemnation. He praised the dam’s completion in 2017 as a monument to India’s progress.    Both the completion of the dam and the statue that celebrates it suggest that the BJP government is backing economic development over human rights and environmental protections.    The statue’s inauguration comes only a month after the country closed the first nature reserve in India since 1972. Modi’s government has also come under sustained criticism for a series of pro-industry policies that have eroded conservation, forest, coastal and air pollution protections, and weakened minority land rights.    India was recently ranked 177 out of 180 countries in the world for its environmental protection efforts.    Despite this record, the United Nations’ Environmental Programme (UNEP) recently awarded Modi its highest environmental award. It made him a Champion of the Earth for his work on solar energy development and plastic reduction.    The decision prompted a backlash in India, where many commentators are concerned by the BJP’s environmental record.    Visitors to the statue will access it via a 5 km boat ride. At the statue’s base, they can buy souvenirs and fast food, before taking a high-speed elevator to the observation deck.    The observation deck will be situated in Patel’s head. From it, tourists will look out over the Sardar Sarovar Dam, as the accompanying commentary praises “united” India’s national development successes.    But let’s not forget the environmental and minority protections that have been sacrificed to achieve these goals.","Statue of Unity: How environment, Adivasi rights lost again to Patel's name",Pre-Construction
"The world’s tallest statue was unveiled today in the western Indian state of Gujarat at a VIP ceremony officiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. At 597 feet, the sculpture is almost twice the height of the Statue of Liberty and dwarfs the Spring Temple Buddha in China, until today the world’s tallest statue, by 177 feet.Named the Statue of Unity, the giant new sculpture immortalizes Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, an Indian independence leader and the country’s first deputy prime minister; it was inaugurated on what would have been his 143rd birthday. As Patel’s bronze-clad likeness gazed over the horizon at Kevadiya Colony, about 260 miles from the Bollywood capital of Mumbai, military aircraft flew overhead, scattering flower petals on the ground and tracing the colors of the Indian flag in plumes across the sky.“This statue is an answer to all those who question India’s power and might,” Modi said in his address, before heading to take part in religious rites to mark the unveiling. “It is my honor to be able to dedicate this statue to the nation.”But not everyone in the nation is thrilled by the gargantuan effigy, which took 33 months to build, at a cost of $400 million, in a public-private venture that was partially crowdfunded. Just hours before the unveiling, close to the site, crowds of farmers and members of tribal communities chanted slogans and tore down posters of the statue in protest against what they see a colossal waste of money.‘They don’t have a past to invoke’In fact, the Statue of Unity hasn’t generated much in the way of harmony since its conception was announced in October 2013 by Modi, who was then the chief minister of Gujarat and a prime ministerial candidate. Critics say that the sculpture is a crude attempt by Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to rewrite political history. Its completion ahead of the highly anticipated 2019 general election is also likely to score big points with the right-wing Hindu voters who make up the BJP’s power base.Patel is one of the legendary figures of Indian nationhood. When the sub-continent’s 584 princely states were given the choice of joining either Pakistan or India following the 1947 Partition, it was Patel who convinced more than 550 of them to join the latter. For that, he became known as the Iron Man of India.He came from humble beginnings in the state of Gujarat—as does Modi, who rarely passes up on an opportunity to express admiration for his fellow Gujarati. The BJP-led coalition even declared Patel’s birthday to be National Unity Day just months after coming to power in 2014.Mahatma Gandhi with Sardar Patel and Jawaharlal Nehru. 1947. Gandhi was the preeminent leader of the Indian independence movement in British-ruled India. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was an Indian statesman, a leader of the Indian National Congress and a founding father of the Republic of India. Universal History Archive-UIG/Getty Images.Universal History Archive-UIG/Getty Images.But there’s just one snag: Patel had nothing to do with the BJP. He was actually a member of the BJP’s great political rival, the center-left Indian National Congress (commonly called the Congress or the Congress Party).Critics say that the BJP, which was founded in 1951, is trying to appropriate Patel’s legacy and aura because it cannot number any preeminent independence leaders among its past members.“For a party that claims to do everything in the name of the nation, they don’t have a past to invoke,” Sucheta Mahajan, professor at the Center of Historical Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, tells TIME.Even worse, the BJP does have a connection to the assassin of independence icon Mahatma Gandhi, who was slain in 1948. Gandhi’s killer, Nathuram Godse, had been a member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the paramilitary Hindu organization regarded as the parent of the BJP.Repeated requests for comment made to several BJP spokespersons for this article went unanswered. However, Modi has argued in the past that Patel was politically sidelined by both Congress and Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s first prime minister (whose great-grandson Rahul Gandhi happens to be Modi’s opponent in the upcoming election).Congress refutes this. “The BJP is trying to build a narrative that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Jawaharlal Nehru were always at loggerheads,” Priyanka Chaturvedi, a spokesperson for Congress, tells TIME. “In trying to politicize and usurp the legacies of our past leaders, the BJP is also making an attempt to demonize us.”‘It’s a matter of shame’Besides its symbolism, questions have also been asked about the physical statue itself. Larsen and Toubro, the construction company that built the effigy, has admitted that its bronze cladding came from China. While the cladding represents only nine percent of the statue, it has the potential to embarrass Modi, who has staked much on a “Make In India” initiative to encourage companies to manufacture locally. Photos circulating online earlier this year, showing Chinese workers at the site of the statue, haven’t helped.“It is a matter of shame that ‘Made in China’ would be engraved behind this statue,” Rahul Gandhi, Congress president, said at a rally in September.Opposition parties, led by the Congress, are bound to taunt Modi with this during campaigning for the 2019 elections, especially given India’s burgeoning unemployment.“This is bound to come up since the atmosphere is very divisive and latching on to anything which is divisive has unfortunately become the motto of political parties in this country,” prominent political scientist Sudha Pai tells TIME.Even as the wrangling over the Statue of Unity continues, a taller and possibly even more divisive sculpture is in the works off the coast of Mumbai. Scheduled for completion in 2021, it is of Chhatrapati Shivaji, a Hindu warrior king, revered for battling Muslim rulers.It is an attempt to symbolize him as a Hindu resurgent leader against Islamic rule, more like a symbol of Hindu-Muslim conflict,” Mohan Guruswamy, president of Center For Policy Alternatives, a public policy organization, tells TIME.Since taking office, the Modi-led government has taken steps to remove some reminders of the Muslim presence in India’s history. The Muslim names of many prominent cities and train stations have been swapped for Hindu alternatives, for instance. And the Taj Mahal—a Muslim mausoleum built by a 17th-century Mughal emperor—has been left out of a tourism brochure issued by the state government of Uttar Pradesh, where the world renowned monument is located.For Pai, symbolism and appropriation have already gone too far. “Statues carry symbols and values with them and we should leave it out because it somehow divides the nation,” she saysFor others, the symbolism of Indian might—and specifically Hindu might—has only just started. “Take note of the message we are sending out to the world with this statue,” a BJP supporter at the unveiling tells TIME. “Just the thought of it sends shivers down my spine.”",What the World's Tallest Statue Says About the World's Biggest Democracy,Pre-Construction
"Ahmedabad:Police have registered a case against some employees of a cash collection agency in Gujarat for allegedly cheating a bank by not depositing the amount of ₹ 5.24 crore during November, 2018 to March, 2020 which was generated from the sale of tickets for the Statue of Unity, an officer said on Wednesday.The bank, in which the Statue of Unity management held two accounts, had hired an agency to collect cash daily from authorities at Kevadia in Narmada district and deposit it the next day, Deputy Superintendent of Police Vani Dudhat told reporters.""However, some staffers of the agency prima facie didn't deposit an amount of ₹ 5,24,77,375 into the bank accounts of the statue management between November 2018 and March 2020,"" said Dudhat.The officer said an FIR was lodged by manager of the private bank against unidentified persons working with the cash collection agency at Kevadia police station on Monday night.Police have registered a case under sections 420 (cheating), 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), Dudhat said, adding that police are yet to make any arrest in the case.The Statue of Unity management said the issue lies between the bank and the cash collection agency concerned. A senior official of the management said the bank has deposited ₹ 5.24 crore into their accounts.The imposing monument of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, called as the Statue of Unity (SoU), is located at Kevadia in Narmada district. The statue has been a major tourist attraction since it was inaugurated in October 2018.A Children Nutrition Park and a Cactus Garden are among other attractions, including river rafting, located in the vicinity of the monument.Before the lockdown, people had the option to buy tickets online or over the counter in cash at the spot.In December last year, Gujarat Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel informed the Legislative Assembly that the statue management earned a revenue of ₹ 82.51 crore between November 1, 2018 and November 16, 2019.Data of revenue from November 2019 to March, 2020 was not released by the government.As per the FIR, the bank has been using services of the agency since 2003 for cash collection and deposition.The bank had appointed the same agency to collect cash generated from the sale of tickets at the Statue of Unity and other connected tourist attractions and deposit it into the two bank accounts of the State of Unity authorities, Mr Dudhat said.""In a recent audit, the State of Unity officials found a mismatch in the amount mentioned in cash deposit slips, given by the agency staff after collecting the cash, and the actual cash deposited into the bank accounts between November 2018 and March 2020,"" she said.After it was informed by the statue management about the mismatch, the bank conducted a probe which revealed that some staff members of the agency allegedly did not deposit ₹ 5.24 crore, following which the bank authorities lodged the FIR, the dySP said.""We need to check several records of the agency to find out who were involved in the cash collection exercise at Kevadia,"" the officer said, adding that no one has been identified or arrested yet.The monument was shut for tourists for almost seven months since March due to coronavirus-induced lockdown, before it was reopened for visitors from October 17 with staggered timings.

"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 31 inaugurated the Statue of Unity, a 182-metre high statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the first Deputy Prime Minister of India.  The statue is certainly many things — it’s the tallest statue in the world, it is an engineering marvel, it’s likely to be a major tourist attraction. What is not so certain is if the statue is indeed a fitting tribute to the Iron Man of India.Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Statue of Unity on October 31. (Photo: PTI) Here are five reasons why the statute is not the best way to pay tribute to a great leader like Patel.The exorbitant costThe statue costs Rs 2,989 crore. In a country like India, this is an obscene amount of money to spend on a statue, when millions of children die of hunger every year. The money could have been used to build a chain of schools or hospitals across the country, which could have been named after Sardar Patel. It could have been used to build a network of roads, named after Patel. It could have been used for starting a new food security scheme, named after Patel.According to a report in IndiaSpend, the budget of the statue could have been used to fund two new IIT campuses, two AIIMS campuses, five new permanent IIM campuses, five new solar power plants or six Mars missions.Farmers' and tribals' protestsIt is actually an insult to Patel to construct his statue in such a manner that protests are held to oppose its inauguration. Farmers and tribals in Gujarat have been protesting against the Statue of Unity project for years, saying it takes away their land and livelihood, and that they have not been adequately compensated for it.In fact, a group of farmers had threatened to kill themselves on the day the statue was to be inaugurated, because they are reportedly yet to be paid their sugarcane dues, which they had sold to a mill — named, ironically, after Sardar Patel.Tribals angry with the project had defaced posters advertising it. The government, instead of hearing their issues, changed the posters with one featuring Birsa Munda, in the hope that the tribals would not deface “their own” hero. On October 30, 16 tribal activists and leaders of the area were detained.The statue was built on the land of farmers and tribals, but they can hardly afford a visit to it — ticket prices start at Rs 120. (Photo: India Today)Harms the environment      The statue has been built in an ecologically sensitive zone in the Narmada riverbed, which, environmentalists say, has geological fault lines.The statue is very near the Shoolpaneshwar Sanctuary, and the construction and tourism activity damage the ecologically sensitive area.Ever since the project was launched, activists have been pointing out that it flouts environmental regulations.Made in ChinaIndia’s great proof of nationalism has been built with Chinese help, a nation whose products WhatsApp patriots routinely ask us to shun.According to a report in Mint, “although the statue was designed and made in India, the bronze panels had to be cast in a foundry in China, since no such facility to handle such a huge project is available in India.”The statue has been built in an ecologically sensitive zone in the Narmada riverbed. (Photo: Business Today)Instead of waiting for an Indian firm to come up with the technology, the government was in such a hurry to inaugurate the statue — maybe with elections in mind — that the work had to be outsourced to China.Competitive prideThe building of monuments and memorials as the biggest proof of admiration for a leader can turn into a competitive sport. Already, Maharashtra is building its own exorbitantly expensive statue of Shivaji Maharaj — mid-sea, very tall, very wonderful.What’s to prevent other states and governments from finding new icons they can use to rally public sentiment around?It is difficult to believe Patel would have been happier to see his own statute rearing into the air, instead of better education, infrastructure and healthcare for his countrymen.",Five reasons the Statue of Unity is not as wonderful as the government would have us believe,Pre-Construction
"Consider the facts: The 600 feet tall statue of Sardar Patel that the Prime Minister of India will inaugurate on Patel’s Birthday on October 31, 2018 is situated bang in the middle of the Narmada river. To take up such unprecedented construction in the middle of the river would require, at the least, environment clearance, since the construction would have huge impacts on the river. No such clearance was sought or given. It would have required environmental impact assessment, environmental management plan, appraisal, public consultations, monitoring and compliance. NONE OF THIS HAPPENED. Smallest Signboard – Janantik ShuklaThe project involves, not only the construction of the statue, but also laying new roads, widening existing roads, setting up five star and other multi star hotels, guest houses by various states, Tent city (Tender issued), ropeway (tender issued), Tiger and crocodile safari, and so on, which would also have adverse impacts, requiring the above procedure, but none happened.The Statue is to be surrounded by water to be dammed by Garudeshwar Dam, on Narmada river, again requiring social and environment impacts assessment and clearances[i], but none were sought or given.No one can step in same river twice, but where is water? Location – Gora bridge, Kevadiya Colony – Janantik ShuklaThe Statue is built from the southern side of Narmada river, 3.2 km downstream from the Narmada Dam. On Northern side is the Shoolpaneshwar sanctuary and reserved forests, which means that such a construction would require wildlife clearance, but again none was sought or given.How uncomfortable would Sardar be seeing so many violations of law? Seeing the expenditure of Rs 3000 crores[ii]?  Seeing the land acquisition and displacement of so many tribal people, who do not have basic developmental facilities or justice till date?Sardar Vallabhabhai Patel, Independent India’s first Home and deputy Prime Minister, was a successful lawyer before he left that profession to join Gandhi in freedom struggle. He would have been happy to fight a case against all these illegalities and injustices involved in building the statue. As he once said[iii]: “If we have to fight, we must fight clean. Such a fight must await an appropriate time and conditions and you must be watchful in choosing your ground. To fight against refugees is no fight at all. No laws of humanity or war among honourable men permit the murder of people who have sought shelter and protection.”Unfortunately, he may have lost that legal battle. Gujarat High Court, in order dated January 13, 2014, in Writ Petition (PIL) 142 of 2013, challenging the plans of the Statue, rejected the petition, without going into issue of impacts or violation of Environment Protection Act 1986 or Wildlife Protection Act 1972.The Western Zone branch of the National Green Tribunal, in response to application no 32 of 2015 by late Trupti Shah and 9 others, challenging the plans of the Statue of Unity, rejected the appeal through an order dated January 28, 2016, without going into merits of the case: “Considering the fact situation in the instant case, in our considered opinion, instant Application No.32/2015 is barred by limitation and will have to be dismissed. Still however, we make it clear that this dismissal is not to be treated as precedent for other purpose. All the questions related to the matter are kept open for both the sides and may not be treated as foreclosed for any purpose.”But Sardar Patel was also a staunch Satyagrahi and would not hesitate to fight for justice, as tribals[iv] and others[v] of Gujarat are now doing.Sardar Patel said in his presidential address to the Congress in 1931[vi]: “Independent India’s leaders would neither use a foreign language nor rule from a remote place 7,000 feet above sea level.”He would certainly feel VERY uncomfortable even from that height of 600 feet.SANDRP (ht.sandrp@gmail.com)A (possibly tribal) woman selling small things near the statue.

However, the government’s measure seems to have failed to pacify the tribals as new posters were also found damaged with Birsa Munda’s image remaining intact. The government has not made any arrest or detention in this regard.”“Meanwhile, ahead of the unveiling of the 182-metre-tall statue of Sardar Patel, 22 village sarpanchs from areas around the statue in Narmada district have written an open letter to Prime Minister Modi urging him to skip the unveiling ceremony on October 31, saying that he won’t be welcomed by the residents of Kevadiya Colony on ‘their land.’“When we are still struggling to avail basic infrastructural facilities for schools, hospitals and drinking water, you decide to spend crores of rupees for the construction of a statue and now again for the inaugural event. With a heavy heart, all of us villagers are telling you that we won’t welcome you on our land in our district,” the letter to PM Modi read.““It pains us to look at what you have done with our land and river with first the construction of the Sardar Sarovar Dam and now with the Statue of Unity,” the letter read. “With first the Dam, a number of people were rendered homeless and jobless. And now with this ambitious project of yours we can’t even fathom the number of people who have and who will lose their livelihoods and homes.””““Being so close to the river and the Sardar Sarovar Canal, we should be the first to avail benefits of drinking water and water for irrigation, but we are yet to avail it.

They say they can see the water passing by their farms through a canal that transports it from the dam, but it’s illegal to divert the water so they are forced to steal it. One of the farmers said he had laid a pipe underground from the canal to his farm, adding that nearly all farmers in the area did this to survive. “We don’t have any option but to take the water illegally as there are no sources of water left for us.””3.

"As Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled the world's tallest statue, the Statue of Unity, in Narmada district in Gujarat on October 31, 2018, the residents of 72 tribal villages who have been directly or indirectly affected by the project boycotted the inauguration by not cooking food. They released black balloons in the sky and burnt tyres to mark their protest. Ahead of Modi's visit, the heads of 22 villages in the vicinity of the dam had written an open letter to him, stating that the villagers would not welcome him at the inauguration. Local tribal leaders announced a boycott of the function citing destruction of natural resources due to the construction of the memorial. A day before the inauguration, several tribal activists and local people were detained as a preventive measure. The affected people consider the statue a ""colossal"" waste of public money. The government has envisioned a tourism zone in the stretch between the Sardar Sarovar Dam and the Statue of Unity. It is touted to have a ""valley of flowers"", a ""Tent City"", a guest house for every state, hotels and a lake for boating, for which the government plans to release water from the Sardar Sarovar dam. The tribals fear submersion of their villages and crops. Some of the villages also lost many acres of land in October when the government widened the access road leading to the statue. Of the 72 villages in which land has been acquired, the residents of only 32 villages have been compensated so far. However, in 19 of these villages, rehabilitation is yet to be completed. People in six villages -Navagam, Vagadia, Limdi, Kevadiya, Kothi and Gora in Kevadiya Colony - have been displaced and are living in temporary shelters. As reported by human rights activist Anand Mazgaonkar, these six villages are not recognised as project-affected. Other affected people include those who have been paid monetary compensation but are awaiting land and jobs as promised under the rehabilitation package as well as those who have been compensated with land but are unhappy as the land is unproductive. Tribal activists also allege that the Statue of Unity project has not taken environmental clearance. According to a report in Down To Earth, the activists wrote a letter to the environment secretary, stating that the statue violates the Environment Protection Act of 1986, environmental impact assessment notification of 2006 and a few orders issued by the National Green Tribunal. The Statue of Unity is only 3.2 km from the Shoolpaneshwar Sanctuary. According to a Supreme Court order dated December 4, 2006, if a project requiring environmental clearance is located within a 10-km radius of a wildlife sanctuary or national park, the project requires the approval of the Standing Committee of the National Board for Wildlife. Meanwhile, the residents of Kevadiya Colony on December 17, 2018, locked the executive engineer of the Sardar Sarovar Punarvasvat Agency in his office at the Statue of Unity site to protest against the lack of jobs for the local people. They also complained of the lack of basic facilities for those displaced by the project. However, police rushed to the site and brought the situation under control. On July 25, 2019, the Gujarat High Court ordered a status quo on the acquisition of land for various tourism projects and asked the state government not to evict anyone until further orders. The court's decision came after a public interest litigation (PIL) was filed against the land acquisition in the six villages. The PIL was filed by Ahmedabad-based environment activist Mahesh Pandya. In the petition, Pandya alleged that the government and the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited want to evict around 5,000 tribals residing in the six villages under the guise of tourism development projects without following due procedure under the Land Acquisition Act. He stated that the land is being acquired for tiger safaris, hotels and other buildings planned near the Statue of Unity to develop tourism. The petitioner further claimed that the land acquired from several tribal families was never utilised for the purpose for which it was acquired and that the physical possession of the land was never taken over. In May 2020, the Gujarat High Court withdrew the stay order on Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL) to acquire the land surrounding the statue. Following this, the company laid fences on open plots of land around the statue in Kevadiya colony. The local residents protested and clashed with the police, in which 20 people were arrested. After a month of protest, on June 5, the fencing work was stopped to facilitate talks with the locals. ","Farmers Affected by Statue of Unity Boycott Inauguration, Yet To Receive Compensation",Post-Construction

The website of Statue of Unity says “the monument will not just be a memorial, but a completely functional, purpose-serving tribute that will boost tourism and facilitate development in the surrounding tribal areas and will involve huge infrastructure.” It adds: “A 13 km long water body (pond) will create an excellent tourist spot with available infrastructure on both the banks.""The Concerned Citizens group has demanded that the Gujarat government should be directed to submit an application, seeking environment clearance.

Hence a relatively new statue of unity will become a star attraction to people within the country and also globally. This helps in revenue generation not only internally but by foreign exchange. This helps in the employment generation locally and puts purchasing power in the hands of people ensuring increased demand and growth.Tourism is a global and intensely competitive industry the consumer has to spend a relatively large amount of his/her disposable income to buy the tourism product. This Statue will offer travelers the opportunity to visit a variety of built and natural attractions along a themed route. By moving away from the well-established destination resort model of tourism development that focuses on a specific locality, tourism corridors offer visitors the opportunity to travel through a variety of landscapes and visit a range of iconic and non-iconic yet locally significant attractions.Tourism is one mechanism for encouraging a move beyond the core, and if properly planned, will stimulate regional economic development by extending the core into the periphery.

"Today on birth anniversary of iron man of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Government of Gujarat along with Prime Minister unveiled his statue in Gujarat. The foundation stone of the project was laid by PM, then Chief Minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi. The statue that has been made open for public today is the world’s tallest statue, almost twice the size of Statue of Liberty. While it is a moment of pride for many Indians, the move has been equally criticized by the Indians.Whopping 3000 crore rupees have been spent to build the statue. While people ask, why not build schools and hospitals with the money, a Quora user Kaustubh Panat shared an opinion which is spot on. Take a look.Why do we need Statue of Unity as much as we need schools and hospitals?I think the idea of Statue of Unity is really good.Answer to your 1’st point: Project has been seen as an extravagant affair, argued with the fact that this much money could be used in providing schools, hospitals and other public projects to people.Well, quoting such allegations is contradictory with the original reason of the money. The Rs. 2000 crore spent now will bring 10 times more money in future.The statue of liberty has around 4.3 million visitors in the year of 2014.Now just imagine.. how much the US govt might be earning from it. How many schools and education centers can be opened if every visitor pays a minim fee of 1$. That is tooooo less!Now take wave back to the project of Statue of Unity…This would be the tallest statue in the world. It would definitely attract the visitors across the globe. This will earn lots and lots of money to the government.If you are daily news reader you would come across that India is already under debt of thousands of crores. So at such crucial time investing in dead assets is very harmful. Building schools is important. But along with that “GAREEB KA PET BHARNA” is also important. This project will open new doors of employment for the maintenance contractors.So i guess.. We should not connect the issue of Tourism Department to the Department of Education.So now Statue of Unity will earn you money that can be used for development of Indian economy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ",This Perspective On Importance Of Statue Of Unity Is Spot On!,Post-Construction
"The foundation-laying ceremony, on October 31, 2013, kick-started then Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi’s 2014 Lok Sabha campaign. And its completion and inauguration, exactly 5 years later on October 31, is being seen as the beginning of Modi’s campaign for a second term in next year’s general election.Hindustan Times, Gandhinagar/Narmada | By Hiral DaveUPDATED ON OCT 31, 2018 12:15 PM ISTEight years after proposing the ambitious project to his cabinet in 2010 ahead of his 10th year as Gujarat chief minister and exactly five years laying its foundation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will Wednesday inaugurate the giant Statue of Unity commemorating India’s first home minister Vallabhbhai Patel, who played a decisive role in the country’s unification following independence from British rule.The daunting scale and nature had raised scepticism even within a section of the state’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) about his government’s ability to execute the plan. But in October that year, Modi made his plan public. “A tribute to the Iron Man of India. At 182 metres, not just in height, but it will also stand tall for historical, academic, national and spiritual values. It will be the first such big project in any tribal part of India and dedicated to subjects close to Sardar saab – unity, good governance and agriculture,” he had said.Eight years later, a consortium of world class construction companies executing the project – Michael Graves Architecture and Designs, Turner Construction and Larsen & Toubro -- is overseeing the countdown to the October 31 inauguration of the statue on Sadhu Bet, a hillock between the Vidhyanchal and Saputara ranges located 3.5 km downstream of the iconic, 138-metre high Sardar Sarovar Dam.",PM Modi’s ambitious project: The story behind the making of Statue of Unity,Pre-Construction
"On 31st October 2018, the Prime Minister of India Mr. Narendra Modi will inaugurate the world’s tallest ‘Statue of Unity' which is built in the loving memory of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the 'Iron Man' of India. It is claimed that it is an engineering marvel reflecting technological, artistic and aesthetical values. The Statue is two times taller than the Statue of Liberty of America.31st October is the birth day of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.In 2014, Mr. Modi promised to the people of India about its completion within four years and it is an exemplary example of the project completion in a stipulated time period. The cost of this project is about Rs 2,990 crores (more than US$400 million). The Statue of Unity is built on the bank of Narmada river in Gujarat state and it has a height of 182 metres.The surrounding areas of the Statue of Unity being developed looks like an excellent tourism spot with all the ultra-modern facilities for the future tourists. This place is going to be turned into one of the best tourist attractions of the world. It will boost further tourism in Gujarat and it is expected to bring an increased income from tourism for the government.Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was known as the 'Iron Man of India' in view of the toughest decisions and actions taken by him that deemed to be strong and hard as iron and steel. When India achieved freedom in 1947, there were 565 princely states and British-era colonial provinces in India. He took up the challenging task of forging a 'United India' by accession of almost every princely state by way of frank diplomacy and by using force wherever required. Based on this, some people call him the 'United Man of India'.Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was born into a farmer's family but he was brought up in an atmosphere with strong values and realities of life. Under Mahatma Gandhi's leadership, he showed his strength of character, sharpness of mind, organizing skills and statesmanship in achieving freedom for India and after independence for India's consolidation. He will always be known as a great personality that inspires every Indian.The completion of Statue of Unity is a true tribute to his foresightedness, sagacity and wisdom. Each and every Indian and Persons of Indian Origin around the world would feel very proud on this remarkable achievement.",The 'Statue of Unity' - A Symbol of Unity in Diversity of India,Pre-Construction
"Attempts to glorify Sardar Patel are a part of Modi govt’s larger efforts to give due recognition to national ‘heroes’ outside the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty.New Delhi: True to his style and politics, Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled a 182-metre tall statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in a grand, ostentatious event in Gujarat Wednesday, with a speech laced with symbolism, political undertones and electoral considerations.Giving Patel — independent India’s first home minister — the entire credit for building a united country, Modi left little unsaid in underlining how the leader has been largely ignored over the past few decades and how it is his government that is giving him his due.The very overt attempts to glorify and honour Patel are a part of the Modi government’s larger efforts to ensure national ‘heroes’ from outside the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty also get due recognition.As part of this, the BJP has not just put forward its own leaders but has also appropriated the more conservative strand of the Congress, including leaders such as Patel and Madan Mohan Malaviya.The statue was unveiled on Patel’s 143rd birth anniversary, that happens to coincide with former PM Indira Gandhi’s death anniversary. The messaging of the flamboyant, grand event that clearly overshadowed tributes to Indira Gandhi was also hardly lost on anyone.Appropriating Patel“Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was responsible for us living in a united India today. It was his efforts after Independence that led to India being what it is today,” Modi said.“From Kutch to Kohima, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, Sardar Patel united the country. This shows what a great resolve he had. It is because of him that we can travel to all the great sites and meet the great people of all the states without a visa,” the PM said.“Sardar Patel was made the home minister of India at the country’s most difficult period. No one can imagine how he managed to keep India from disintegrating after Partition. The greatness of his deeds cannot be put in words. Each and every one of us owes it to this man for what he has done for the country,” he added.According to top sources in the BJP, the PM’s very evident underlining of Patel as the one responsible for a united India is a clear way to pit him against India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, and highlight the former’s contribution versus the latter’s.In its traditional worldview, the BJP and its parent outfit RSS, have been pro-Patel and anti-Nehru. They’ve held that Patel represented a hard, muscular state, someone who stood for a united India with strong Hindu roots, as against the more westernised elite they have perceived Nehru as.Modi also said without Patel, it would have been difficult to create the structure of the Indian civil services. He said it was Patel who was responsible for giving women the right to make an active contribution to politics in the country.Modi, as chief minister of Gujarat in 2013, had laid the foundation stone of the project, and sources say he has personally supervised its progress since.BJP for a ‘united’ IndiaThe PM’s entire speech centred around the theme of unity, with the slogan ‘Ek Bharat, Shresth Bharat’ finding mention multiple times. While underscoring how Patel had ensured India does not disintegrate after Independence, Modi tried to send out an emphatic message about how BJP stands for a united India — an unmistakable pitch to its vote bank ahead of the forthcoming state and Lok Sabha polls.“There were many pessimists who used to always think that a diverse country like India can never remain united. It will fall apart. But, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel showed how it is done. We should learn how to grow from strength to strength, how to always stay united,” the PM said.“Statue of Unity is a symbol of India’s integrity, India’s resolve, India’s determination and India’s unity,” he added.Modi’s constant stress on an integrated nation was as much a way to highlight Patel’s contribution as it was to appropriate the message as something the BJP stands for.Political and electoral undertonesBJP’s push for Patel is hardly devoid of well-thought out political objectives. To begin with, it helps the BJP make a fresh bid to reach out to Gujarat’s influential and electorally crucial Patel community, which had deserted it in the 2017 state elections, causing the party much damage.Given Gujarat sends 26 members to the Lok Sabha, of which the BJP won all in the 2014 elections, the party would hardly want to take risk of not making active efforts to build bridges with the community. Patels or Patidars make up for roughly 14 per cent of the state’s population.In addition, given Sardar Patel’s farmer roots, the idea is to also pander to the farmer community, which, in Gujarat and other parts of the country, has expressed its unhappiness with the BJP government. Since coming to power in 2014, the Modi government has attempted to cultivate a pro-farmer image, launching several programmes for the rural sector.The PM, in his speech, pointed to Patel’s farmer roots and said this “extraordinary” man was born in an ordinary farmer family.“In order to build the Statue of Unity, lakhs of farmers from all over India came together, gave their tools, portions of the soil and thus, a mass movement developed,” Modi said.Not oblivious to the criticisms about the need to construct the grand statue, Modi was careful to point out how this was not just a manifestation of Patel’s resolve and talent, but was also an expression of the “confidence of a new India”.He also talked about how it would bring “prosperity to the tribals, farmers and villagers in this region”, bringing them better livelihood and business opportunities through tourism.In a veiled but difficult to miss attack at the Congress, which has dismissed the move as tokenism, Modi said he is “amazed” at how even this is “politicised” by forces in the country.“We are criticised even for praising great men like Sardar Patel. We are made to feel that we have committed a big crime,” he said.With this, the PM evidently attempted to indicate the Congress was reluctant to glorify Patel, and was targeting the BJP merely for political reasons.Leaving behind a legacySources in the party also say this is PM Modi’s way of creating his own legacy to leave behind, and this was reflected in his speech as well.“Today is a day that will be remembered in the history of India. No Indian will ever forget this day,” he claimed.Modi also subtly slipped in his own rise to the top, when he said he had conceived this idea as chief minister of Gujarat, but had never imagined he would unveil the statue as the prime minister.BJP’s internal dynamicsUnderneath the glitter and glamour of the grand show, the event to unveil Patel’s statue was an unlikely, but unmistakable, reflection of BJP’s own altered power dynamics.In 2013, Modi as chief minister had invited veteran BJP leader L.K. Advani to do the bhoomi pujan for the statue. On Wednesday, the very leader who had performed the ground-breaking ceremony was nowhere to be seen.The troubled equation between Advani and Modi ahead of 2014 as the latter made his PM candidature pitch was hardly a secret. After coming to power, the Modi-led party relegated Advani, among other veterans, to the margdarshak mandal, a subtle way of conveying he would no longer play an active political, organisational or decision-making role in the party.Advani’s absence from Wednesday’s event, therefore, is as part of the same tale of the generational shift and altered dynamics in the BJP.This was also a reflection of the steep rise of Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, who was on the sidelines at the 2013 foundation stone laying ceremony, but was seated as the CM on the dais at the unveiling of the statue just five years later.","In Modi’s Statue of Unity show, a cocktail of politics, symbolism & BJP’s changed dynamics",Pre-Construction
"If there is one country in the world that understands the importance of national unity, it is the United States of America. After all it fought a civil war to preserve it. That’s why the first memorial to Abraham Lincoln, the man who fought to keep the country together, came up in 1868, just three years after his assassination, at the District of Columbia City Hall.But that was not enough. By the turn of the century, demand had grown for a grander memorial. With a $300,000 budget, and after raising its height to 19 feet because 10 feet just didn’t seem tall enough, it was inaugurated in 1922. Remarkably, this social investment was made during the Roaring Twenties, a decade when the US economy grew by 42 per cent and mass manufacturing brought consumer goods within reach of more Americans than ever before.India is experiencing a similar rate of economic growth, but that’s not the only reason why a 182-metre statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel — twice the height of the Statue of Liberty — seems apt right now.The Lincoln memorials were built to remind a once deeply divided country about the man who brought it together. It is worth remembering that they were built by people worrying about a country where people spoke one primary language and followed one principal faith — two of the most potent reasons that break nations apart.There was, of course, no such uniformity of language or religion in India that more than five hundred princely states could be merged — without, as Soviet premier Nikolai Bulganin noted, eliminating the princes. That no royal head rolled during the integration of princely states with British India to create the modern nation state was almost entirely due to Vallabhbhai Patel. Moreover, as Patel biographer P. N. Chopra noted, “Sardar’s India was greater in size than that of Samudragupta, Asoka and Akbar, and the writ of the Centre wielded an authority and respect never dreamt of by these great rulers.” This is why it is apt that the statue of Patel is called the “Statue of Unity”.There are at least 15 statues of Jawaharlal Nehru around India, including by Ram Vanji Sutar, who has designed the Statue of Unity. There are statues of M K Gandhi in nearly 70 countries, one of the most recent being the one that came up in 2015 at London’s Parliament Square, after a well-publicised campaign led by economist-politician Meghnad Desai.True, Patel also had a couple of statues to his name, but none that recognised his contribution to the national movement on par — as it undoubtedly was — with Gandhi and Nehru. That is why, when Rajmohan Gandhi wrote his book on Patel more than two decades ago, he complained that while praise given to Gandhi was dutiful, and to Nehru fulsome, it was niggardly about Patel.This concern is supported by a couple of telling examples. Nehru got a Bharat Ratna as a sitting prime minister in 1955, while Patel’s award had to wait till 1991. Gandhi and Nehru even got their own adjectives – Gandhian and Nehruvian – but there is no ‘Patelian’.This is so because Patel’s contribution has barely been recognised in the way Indian history is learnt. Most Indians do not understand that the map that they have been taught to call India would not exist, or would look very different, without Vallabhbhai Patel.But perhaps the most important void that the Statue of Unity might fill is that of the trio that led India’s struggle for freedom only Patel never told his story. Both Gandhi and Nehru wrote voluminously about the saga as they saw it. But Patel, when asked by his daughter why he didn’t write his version, famously said that some write history and others create it.But this statue might just fill the gap.Hindol Sengupta is Editor-at-large at Fortune India, and the author of the recently published book The Man Who Saved India: Sardar Patel and His Idea of India.",Why India needs the Statue of Unity                        ,Pre-Construction

They are optimal to pay homage and tribute to notable personalities in the past as well as symbolize ideologies and beliefs. Be it the Statue of Liberty in the USA signifying freedom and enlightenment or the Christ the Redeemer in Brazil. They are personifications of historical movements and revolutions. Since India is a land of people belonging to diverse ethnicities, it does take pride in the unity among its demography.To symbolize this unification of people, princely states, and territories into the Union of India, the Government of India erected a monument dedicated to the first home minister of Independent India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.

"The Statue of Unity (SoU) site in Kevadia village is in the spotlight again, after the Gujarat government tightened vigil around it to prevent villagers from protesting by farming on land acquired by it for building various infrastructure to boost tourism.On June 17, the Narmada district administration formed five teams to keep vigil on the acquired farmlands in six villages around the SoU recently fenced by the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd. (SSNNL). Since then, four cases of trespassing have been registered against villagers in Gora, Navagam and Limdi.The villages that protested in May and June when SSNNL began fencing the land after the Gujarat High Court dismissed their petitions, include Vaghadiya, Kevadia and Kothi.The Gujarat government had originally acquired the land in 1961, for the construction of the Narmada dam canal and subsequently transferred possession to SSNNL, a wholly-owned Gujarat government public limited company that was incorporated in March 1989 to execute and manage the Sardar Sarovar Dam project.SSNNL was part of the trust that built the 182-metre statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on behalf of the government of Gujarat and continues to manage the structure. The Gujarat government, last year cleared a bill to set up a Statue of Unity Area development authority to help expedite projects in the area that is predominantly tribal.Although the SSNNL has almost completed the fencing of the land, about 250 original landholders and their heirs are yet to accept the compensation offered by the SSNNL.General Manager (Technical & Co-ordination) of Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL) M B Joshi, said, “A significant time has passed and the younger generation may not even know the facts of the compensation awarded to their forefathers. Moreover, we cannot consider the third or fourth generations of the landholders as beneficiaries. The younger generation feels they are not getting anything. The value of the cash compensation has now gone down and the market value of the lands is high. We are willing to discuss the compensation and take their suggestions.”Villagers claim they have not been taken into confidence in the plan to develop Kevadia as a tourist hub. (Express Photo: Bhupendra Rana)What villagers argueThe villagers of Limdi, Kevadia, Vagadiya, Navagam, Kothi and Gora say that the government had acquired the land 59 years back, for the building of the Sardar Sarovar dam, but is now intending to put the land to use for other commercial purposes and not for the dam, which is why the SSNNL claim on the should be invalidated.They have been backed by the Bharatiya Tribal Party (BTP) founded by Chhotu Vasava who has also called it the ‘Statue of Displacement’ and the Congress which also staged a demonstration against the police detaining protesting tribals.The six villages filed a PIL in Gujarat High Court protesting the acquisition and calling the compensation offered “meagre”. The HC dismissed their petition in May, after which the SSNNL began fencing the land. After several incidents of trespassing, the police pitched a tent on one of the hillocks for a commanding vigil of the area.On June 25, a group of women from Kevadia village led by a villager Leela Tadvi, took over the tent and declared that they would not move till the police removed it.Deputy Superintendent of Police, Kevadia, Vani Doodhat clarified that the tent was only for a panoramic view of the area as “there is sensitive installation with Narmada dam and Statue of Unity” and that it was not for “vigil on their land”.Deputy Collector and Administrator of Kevadia, Nikunj Parikh says he is duty-bound to protect the land acquired by SSNNL as the administrator of Kevadia was the “custodian of the SSNNL land”. He asserts, “This will be a continuous exercise because no one can farm in the government land. We will take legal action against trespassers.”Predominantly a population of Tadvi tribals, two of the six villages, Kevadia and Vagadiya, are bitter about being called “illegal occupants” on their own farmlands. The land acquired from both these villages faces the main road and is in close proximity to the SoU where hotels and resorts are coming up.What SSNNL saysIn its reply to the High Court, SSNNL said that the government acquired physical possession of land in five villages measuring 1814.65 acres and paid compensation packages. But since the lands were not utilised, the villagers returned to their lands and subsequently the original landholders died.According to SSNNL, as per the Narmada Waters Dispute Tribunal (NWDT) Award of 1979, the six villages had 238 landholders, of which about 105 original landholders are yet to agree upon the compensation package. Similarly, 241 men, sons of the original landholders, were counted as beneficiaries and of these, about 120 are yet to accept the compensation.Although the SSNNL has almost completed the fencing of the land, about 250 original landholders and their heirs are yet to accept the compensation offered by the SSNNL. (Express Photo: Bhupendra Rana)The compensation packageAs per the guidelines of the Narmada Control Authority (NCA), male heirs of a landholder, displaced due to the project, who are 18 years of age as of November 1 1989, are to be given land measuring two hectares or the original size of their land — whichever is bigger — as well as a 250 sq feet plot for animal husbandry.The villagers have the option to choose monetary compensation of Rs 7.5 lakh per hectare (2.4 acres) of land acquired. The villagers, however, claim that the current market value of the land is about Rs 35 lakhs per acre.SSNNL has proposed resettlement of 1000 families to an ‘Adarsh Vasahat’ project planned by expert architects, to be constructed over 16 hectares of land belonging to SSNNL in Gora village.In addition, SSNNL has offered to allot shops in a shopping complex to be built in the SoU parking area for those whose shops were razed during the process of acquisition. SSNNL officials say this would include even those affected families, who were not part of the original list of beneficiaries.",Explained: Why is trouble brewing around Statue of Unity in Gujarat?,Post-Construction

They said if anyone tried to do farming here, they would impose a heavy fine on that person and take strict action against them,” said 70-year-old Punabhai Tadvi, a resident of Navagam village in Narmada district, Gujarat.Navagam, along with the villages of Kevadia, Limdi, Gora and Vaghadia, is in the Narmada district of Gujarat, where the SSNNL, a state government undertaking, claims the lands of the Tadvi Adivasis. The lands of these villagers lie in the area around the statue of Sardar Patel in Kevadia, also known as the Statue of Unity (SoU) and touted as the tallest statue in the world. A number of tourism projects have been constructed around this statue, such as the Shrestha Bharat Bhawan, Tent City, Jungle Safari, Zarvani Eco-tourism & Adventure Sports and Ekta Mall. More such projects are in the pipeline.But the construction of these tourism projects means that many Tadvis have lost their agricultural land without due notice.Kannubhai Tadvi, a 45-year-old Adivasi from Limdi village, had lost his family’s agricultural land in 1974 when the state government began constructing the Sardar Sarovar Dam.“In the year I was born, my family lost their agricultural land. The debris of three hills that were cut to make the dam was dumped on our land without informing our panchayat (village council). This made the land unfit for agriculture,” he told The Wire. “In recent years, a helipad was made on my land for the helicopters of politicians. Now the helipad has been shifted to some other place and a parking lot for buses is being developed there instead.”Also read: In Gujarat, Tribal Evictions, State Repression in the Guise of TourismHe added: “When we ask the Nigam officials why our land around the statue was taken away, they say our forefathers gave it to them. But when I say that my father is still alive, so why was his land taken for the tiger safari project near the statue, they have no answer and ask us to go to court.”Because of the loss of this land, Kannubhai and his family could never practice agriculture. They earn their livelihood as street vendors, selling tea, water bottles and other small items.Dakshaben Tadvi, a 40-year-old Adivasi woman who works with her husband, Kannubhai, said, “Most of the people in our village are not able to practice agriculture because construction has been done on their lands by SSNNL. Now we only have our homes, on which they want to build big hotels. But we are not going to give our homes away.”The Sardar Sarovar Dam. Photo: Kashyap Vyas/Flickr (CC BY-SA 2.0)As per Punabhai Tadvi from Navagam, people of his village collectively lost 30-40 acres of their land to submergence by waters from the Garudheshwar Weir that is situated near the Statue of Unity. The weir is a small dam and also a power generation component of the Sardar Sarovar Project.“Nobody informed us that land would be drowned by this weir. Nor have we heard about compensation from any official,” said Punabhai, who grows cereals like jawar, bajra, makai and dals like tuar for a living.The land of the villagers had been acquired in the early 1960s by the Gujarat government for the construction of the Sardar Sarovar Dam and its necessary adjuncts. But later the engineers moved the position of the dam a few kilometres upwards from the initial intended position because of a technical issue. Hence, the villagers continued to hold “possession” by living and practicing agriculture in parts of the acquired land.Now the SSNNL has fenced off a part of this land and wants to possess the rest of the land too, but the villagers argue that tourism was not the reason for which their family lands had been acquired in the 1960s.For the SSNNL, the situation is very clear. “The question of losing land to tourism development is a misnomer because the land is presently not owned by them [the Tadvi Adivasis],” said M.B. Joshi, chief general manager (technical & coordination) of the SSNNL. “The land is owned by SSNNL after having acquired it by completing the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (LAQ), process, which is also endorsed and stamped by Hon’ble Gujarat High Court. Continuing with the illegal encroachment despite Hon’ble Court’s judgment does not provide them any legal platform to claim any compensation in the name of tourism development.”In May 2020, the Gujarat High Court removed the temporary stay order that had been in place for a year on SSNNL’s process of physically acquiring the land around the Statue of Unity. As a result , the SSNNL then resumed the process of land acquisition and fenced the various open plots of land belonging to the Adivasis from the five villages.When the police reached Kevadia village on May 27, they were asked questions by villagers who wanted to know why their land was being fenced.“They beat up the villagers who demanded an answer. Even the women were beaten up by the policemen,” alleged a farmer from Kevadia on the condition of anonymity. The protests by the villagers to preserve their land led to the police detaining 20 tribals.“When protests took place before the lockdown, civil society activists from other districts would go to Narmada district to support the tribals. But during the lockdown, nobody could go and the tribals were on their own,” said Dev Desai, an independent activist associated with the tribal cause.The lack of on-ground support for the tribals during the lockdown came in the wake of serving of a notice of banishment to Lakhan Musafir from the five tribal districts, including Narmada, in March this year. Musafir has been an active advocate of the rights of the Tadvi Adivasis against the proposed tourism projects.The SSNNL later released a public statement on the Kevadia incident in which it said that only that land that had been measured as part of the acquisition claim had been fenced and that no other private land had been forcefully acquired.","Gujarat: Sardar Sarovar Dam, Statue of Unity Made Tadvi Adivasis Encroachers on their Own Lands",Post-Construction
"Located in a remote stretch in Narmada district, the ‘Statue of Unity’ is anticipated to give a major boost to the Gujarat’s tourism industry. It has already been recognised as one of World's 100 greatest places in 2019 by the TIME Magazine. Its development is expected to stimulate growth in the allied sectors, including real estate in Gujarat. 99acres.com delves deeper into this and finds out how.With the inauguration of the 182-m tall ‘Statue of Unity’, the land of rich and vibrant cultural heritage, Gujarat, has positioned itself as a leading tourist destination. The statue unveiled by the Prime Minister on 31st October, 2018 was presented as a tribute to freedom fighter Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on his 143rd birth anniversary. The spectacular monument, which is twice the height of Statue of Liberty in the US and four times the height of Christ the Redeemer in Brazil is touted to be the world’s tallest statue and is constructed on Sadhu Bet island, near the Sardar Sarovar Dam in Narmada district. Moreover, it has been listed in the TIME magazine as World's 100 Greatest Places of 2019. Simultaneously, it attracted 34,000 visitors in a single day, setting up a new record in itself. A mammoth amount of Rs 3,000 crore has been spent on creating this record-breaking statue, and the history suggests that its development will propel the growth of several industries in its vicinity. Once-in-a-lifetime statues or structures such as the Statue of Unity not only create tourism opportunities, but also give rise to infrastructure development and promote growth in allied sectors. For instance, the development of Eiffel Tower in Paris proved to be an epicenter of growth and has played a monumental role in carving a name for the city on the global map.Case study on Eiffel TowerWhen Eiffel Tower was constructed by Gustave Eiffel to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution, it was widely denounced in its time. However, over the years, the venue has become one of the most visited tourist sites in the world and attracts 70 lakh visitors every year, 75 percent of which are foreigners. An estimated 300 million visitors from all over the world had come to witness the magnificent monument during its opening in 1889. Today, it generates a revenue worth 87 million USD every year.How will the Statue of Unity impact real estate in Gujarat?Impact on tourism industry: The government’s plan to establish a huge tourism hub on the lines of the Kutch winter festival near the statue will promote tourism in the region. The hub will offer adventure activities and water sports to the tourists along with world-class light and sound show and musical fountains. To start with, basic infrastructure such as a tent city near Sadhu Bet will come up with 250 tents that will remain operational throughout the year. State tourism minister, Ganpat Vasava, has even said that the site will attract foreign tourists and holds the potential to be developed as an eco-tourism site. An average of 15,000 visitors are expected at the site on a daily basis.Infrastructure development: The government’s decision to set-up basic tourist infrastructure at certain offbeat destinations in the State such as the Narmada district will certainly increase their attractiveness index. Not only will it trigger commercial real estate growth in the region, but it will also offer an immense opportunity to contribute to social development and stability, inclusive economic growth and heritage preservation. Development of transport modes to reach the location will gradually propel both commercial and residential growth in the nearby areas.Growth of allied sectors: The last few years have seen the tourism and hospitality sector attracting investments worth Rs 11,000 crore. Increased tourism activities due to the newly-inaugurated Statue of Unity will pave the way for setting up of new industries in the allied sectors such as hospitality, transportation and handicrafts. A 3-star Shrestha Bharat Bhavan hotel has already been built near the statue. As of date, the government is analysing the demand of both domestic and international tourists, basis which different categories of hotels will be set-up in the future.Employment generation: Growth in tourism and other allied sectors will create ample employment opportunities for the locals and tribals living near the dam in Narmada district. As of date, it has been decided that the tent city will employ at least 15 percent locals. Further, training is also being imparted to guides to meet the increased tourist traffic that is likely to be generated after the inauguration of the statue. However, for a tourism hub to flourish, employment of qualified and skilled manpower is essential which will be a significant challenge for the government.According to the government, an estimated 15,000 visitors are expected to visit this monument daily. However, the moot question is whether it can match the same popularity as enjoyed by some of the most iconic structures in the world such as the Eiffel Tower. Only time will tell if it can attract global tourists and become the new magnet of tourism for India and real estate development for Gujarat.                        ",Statue of Unity awarded one of World's 100 greatest places in 2019,Post-Construction

The Pratapnagar-Kevadiya stretch was also electrified.The PM said that for the first time in the history of Railways, trains have been flagged off for the same destination from different corners of the country This is because of the importance of Kevadiya as the home to Statue of Unity and the Sardar Sarovar dam. “Today’s event exemplifies the vision of railways and mission of Sardar Patel,” he said.In its inaugural run train no. 09127 Dadar-Kevadiya Superfast Special Express departed from Dadar at 11.12 am and reached Kevadiya at 6.42 pm.

"Ever since King Sudasa of the Trtsu-Bharata tribe took the title of 'Chakravartin' after the daśarājná yuddhá (Battle of 10 Kings), the dream of a united Bharatvarsh has stirred the hearts of Indian kings and emperors.Every monarch has dreamt of himself as the great Varāha, protecting the land encompassing Bharat from the chaos of foreign invasions and sought to unite Bharatvarsh under a single polity. But none of them could realise the description of Bharat in the Vishnu Purana: ""The country that lies north of the ocean and south of the snowy mountains is called Bhāratam...”For millennia, this dream remained unfulfilled until reawakened by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj as ‘Hindavi Swarajya’ in modern India and later adopted by the Indian nationalist movement — the dream of a united Bharatvarsh under self-rule.But it still remained a dream until the opportune moment came and from the ranks of men rose a commoner, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, to seize the moment.Armed with iron will imbued in the best traditions of realpolitik, Patel welded the territories of British India and 562 princely states into a single political entity which were to later become the Republic of India. What he achieved was a feat which surpasses the greatest political triumphs in world history — a largely peaceful unification of India.What was achieved is the culmination of the aspiration of a people for millennia and will resonate in history yet to come.What he achieved was so momentous that it is baffling why his legacy was sidelined and why we failed to celebrate its historical significance for so long?But all that is set to change with the dedication of the world’s largest statue, the Statue of Unity, to the nation by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Statue of Unity is not only a fitting tribute to the man who resurrected the Somnath Temple from ruins after centuries of depredation, but is also a reaffirmation of the will of 1.3 billion Indians to resurrect India from centuries of foreign rule.The statue stands tall and proud, inspiring awe from all those who walk in its shadows, reminding them of the enormity of the task each generation has before it — to preserve the unity and integrity of the country from those who would rather see it disintegrate. This massive feat of engineering instils confidence among the youth that nothing is impossible in ‘New India’.But there are those who would rather have Patel forgotten.They have left no stone unturned in branding Patel as a bucolic right-wing communalist who was responsible for the Partition of India, deflecting blame thus from Muhammad Ali Jinnah.And the same people today are raising objections to the Statue of Unity. These campus communists and regressive leftists have never accepted a united India and seek its disintegration due to their ideological belief that ‘revolution’ would be easier in the smaller entities resulting from fragmentation.They know that the Indian state created by Sardar Patel is the greatest impediment to their dreams of seeing the red flag fluttering and gun-toting left-wing terrorists swarming Indian cities and storming the seat of power to overthrow the republic. It must be remembered how Patel ruthlessly shattered the violent dreams of the communists in Telangana after the suppression of Islamist violence after the liberation of Hyderabad from the Nizam and Razakars.The staunch socialists have turned into overnight avid capitalists, doing ‘value for money’ analysis with regard to the Statue of Unity. But make no mistake! They conjure flimsy arguments to criticise the monument because they hate Patel and what he represents — a strong and united Indian state.Just like those who oppose and ridicule the statue of BR Ambedkar do so not because they are concerned about the ‘waste of resources’ but because they hate what it represents.Patel’s statue represents the determination of people to live under a united India. The statue of Ambedkar represents the aspiration to build a socially just modern society. Neither is possible without the other.Social justice is not possible without a strong state that enforces the Constitution and a strong state is not possible without ensuring social justice and integrating all castes and communities in the national project.The modern Indian state is the only political entity in the history of this land to take a clear stand against the caste system. It’s under this state that subalterns have seen the greatest improvement in their conditions and unprecedented socio-economic mobility. And it has all become possible because of the existence of a united India capable of defending its people from chaos and allowing the healing of a land laid to waste by repeated invasions.And none of this would have been possible without Patel’s vision and endeavours.It is also interesting to note that both Sardar Patel and Dr Ambedkar had determinedly opposed the leftists — and Modi has embarked on a campaign to commemorate them by building monuments and statues dedicated to the two leaders across the country.The ‘Panchteerth project’ seeks to redevelop Ambedkar’s birthplace in Mhow, the place in London where he stayed while studying in the UK, ‘Deeksha Bhoomi’ in Nagpur, ‘Mahaparinirvan Sthal’ in Delhi and ‘Chaitya Bhoomi’ in Mumbai in addition to the grand Ambedkar International Centre in Delhi.Those who criticise the statue are also the same who mock Ambedkar’s memorials as a ‘waste of money’. They do so because they fear the spread of alternative ideas of India challenging the left-wing Nehruvian idea of India, which has so far dominated the discourse due to state patronage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           P",Why the Statue of Unity is such a pain for the left and liberals,Pre-Construction

It is a tribute to the man who united India, Sardar Patel.”The estimated cost was Rs 2,989 crore to build the world’s tallest statue.The stunning statue is designed by Padma Bhushan-winning sculptor Ram V Sutar and built by the construction company Larsen and Toubro and state-run Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd (SSNNL).A campaign called “Loha” was launched to collect iron from all over the country to build the statue of Sardar Patel.The statue of Sardar Vallabhai Patel can withstand earthquakes measuring up to 6.5 on the Richter scale and wind speed of 60m/sec.The viewing gallery, at 153 metres height, can accommodate 200 visitors at a time.

"The Gujarat High Court has ordered ‘status quo’ on the matter of acquisition of land near the controversial Statue of Unity in Narmada district. The land is reportedly being acquired for tourism projects. While giving its order, the HC asked the state government not to evict anyone till further notice.The HC was hearing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) against the ongoing land acquisition process in six villages situated close to the 182 metre tall statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel at Kevadiya near the Sardar Sarovar Dam. The impacted villages are Kevadiya, Vagadiya, Navagam, Limbdi, Kothi and Gora.The HC also served notices to the Gujarat government and Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd (SSNNL) apart from asking it not to go ahead with the land acquisition.A city based environmental activist Mahesh Pandya had filed the PIL in which he alleged that the government and SSNNL want to evict around 5000 Adivasis “under the guise of tourism development projects without following due procedure under the Land Acquisition Act”.In the PIL, he also mentioned that the government has been claiming that the land in question was already acquired in 1960s. However, its actual possession remained with the villagers as the authorities never utilised that land. Since the land hadn’t been acquired so far, the authority of the govt. to acquire it had lapsed, said the PIL.Now, the government and SSNNL have started the process of taking the actual possession, claiming the land in question was already acquired and the villagers have to shift elsewhere, said the PIL.Pandya also argued in the petition that the respondents have large tracts of unused land at all such villages but they want the tribals to shift elsewhere. He said that once the acquisition has lapsed, the respondents have no right, title, or interest in the land in question.The petition added, ""The proceedings of the land acquisition lapsed long back and the respondents cannot claim to evict these villagers from different parcels of land which, though shown in the name of SSNNL or government, are in actual and physical possession of the tribal villagers,"" it added. The structure, built at an exorbitant Rs. 2989 crore is one of the most ambitious projects of the Gujarat government supposedly “to attract tourists”. The statue overlooks the Sardar Sarovar Dam on the Narmada river.  It has attracted widespread criticisms from activists for its environmental oversight and its displacement of the local Adivasis. The land on which the statue is built was already forcibly taken away from Adivasis in the first place. Apart from the colossal wastage of money to build the structure, it has also been criticised for its design and intent. One of the other intentions behind the statue is to promote the figure of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel as a symbol on “Indian Nationalism” and free market development. Though it was supposed to be built with private and public money, the state of Gujarat ended up paying most of the US$416.67 million price tag The Gujarat government had claimed that the investment in the statue was supposed to promote tourism, and that tourism is “sustainable development”, a concocted logic in itself, it has turned out far from it. The UN says that sustainable tourism increases environmental outcomes and promotes local cultures. However, since the statue has been created, it has served neither of these purposes. Instead there has been a huge influx of tourists without any checks and balances on how it is impacting the delicate environment around it. The structure of the statue itself has invited a lot of criticism. It has used some 5000 tonnes of iron, 75000 cubic metres of concrete, 5700 tonnes of steel and 22500 tonnes of bronze sheets and funnily, this symbol of “Indian Nationalism” has been made by a Chinese architect and the bronze sheeting was put in place by Chinese labour. The statue’s position next to the controversial Sardar Sarovar Dam is also telling. While chief minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014, Modi pushed for the dam’s construction despite the World Bank’s condemnation. He praised the dam’s completion in 2017 as a monument to India’s progress.",Interim relief for Gujarat Adivasis as land acquisition stalled near Statue of Unity: Guj HC,Post-Construction

"The simmering anger of thousands of tribals in Gujarat’s eastern belt snowballed into a deafening silence today as Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled a statute of Sardar Patel, touted to be the world’s tallest statue.Scores of villages remained shut and stoves were not lit in home kitchens as a symbol of mourning. Traditionally, no food is cooked when mourning the dead.As many as 75,000 people from at least 72 villages have been affected by the Statue of Unity located at Sadhu Bet island, which is three km from the Sardar Sarovar Project and within the Garudeshwar weir supporting the dam.The state machinery, including the top bureaucracy, executive officers, State Reserve Police Force and home guard companies were pressed into service to ensure Modi’s big show-stopper moment ahead of the crucial 2019 electoral battle was picture perfect.  Through Tuesday night, a huge posse of policemen deployed in Narmada district, indiscriminately knocked at the huts and thatched homes and more than 90 social and human rights activists were whisked away without giving any reason.A local activist Mudita Vidrohi told Down To Earth, “My mother and me were picked up without any reason as though we were hardcore criminals. We were there just to express our solidarity with the Adivasis and there was no public protest programme planned by us or the tribal organisations.” Mudita posted a video on the social media that showed others, including journalists being taken away.  Tribals from across the eastern tribal belt of Gujarat, not just Narmada district, were protesting against the 182-metre statue, two times the height of the Statue of Liberty. There were reports of police making arrests of tribals even in the Dang forests and Banaskantha district in the North to prevent them from staging any demonstrations.Tribal leader Praful Vasava, who has been at the forefront of the protest ever since the then chief minister Narendra Modi had declared the project in 2013, says, “We have never had any problems with the statue, but we can’t keep quiet about something which hits at our very existence.”Of the 72 villages affected by the statue, rehabilitation has been left half way in 32. The Kevadia Colony that houses the staff of the Sardar Sarovar Narmada dam project is likely to affect six villages. In seven villages in Garudeshwar block, cash compensation was given but other commitments like land for land or jobs have not been fulfilled.A local human rights activist, Anand Mazgaonkar, who was detained by the police says, “There are as many as 13 villages with an approximate population of 20,000 which have been directly affected by the land acquisition for the statue project. This also includes land plots taken away for road widening, a 53-room hotel and a host of tourist facilities around the structure.”   He has also said that the first six villages acquired for Sardar Sarovar staff colonies were never recognised as project affected and that they are still fighting this.“The 19 villages that were, in fact, recognised as project-affected are fighting because promises made repeatedly to them were not kept. The seven villages that would be affected by Garudeshwar weir are fighting for their rights,” he added.Besides, 28 villages on the right bank of the Narmada dam's main canal are not allowed to share a drop of water even in this rain-scarce year. They have also resolved to fight, says Mazgaonkar.",Statue of Unity or Statue of Tribal Injustice? ,Pre-Construction

The terrorisation of the people reached a fever pitch on March 28, 2015 when six of the affected villagers and three children while registering their peaceful protest for not even receiving compensation for their “acquired” land were illegally arrested and held without proper food and facilities.Now a police force stands guard 24X7 outside the newly raised gate through which the people have to pass in order to access their homes and land, turning their homes into in a veritable “Open Air Prison”. But this is only the most recent event in a long line of repression against the people’s democratic opposition to the controversial project. Harassment of activists and locals started right from the time of laying the foundation stone of the Statue of Unity (October 31, 2013), when they questioned the Gujarat government over not securing the requisite environmental clearance for the project. Rather than responding to the concerns raised, the government illegally arrested local tribals; some other activists were put under house arrest.The strategy of the Gujarat government was to follow its routine practice of “preemptively” arresting local activists as and when any state or corporate function was organised. Indications are aplenty that this is just the beginning of the crackdown; in the coming years the Government will step up its offensive as conflicts mount over increasing number of tribals being forced to leave their tea shops, marginal landholdings, and ancestral homes to give way for this luxury tourism project and the “development” regime.The eagerness with which the government wishes to somehow complete the project is evident in its willingness to sell off tribal land for a pittance; for example a December, 2014 Resolution of the Gujarat government clearly states: “Considering the security of Statue of Unity and Sardar Sarovar Dam if the need arise the remaining land for Garudeshwar weir can be bought at the rate of Rs 7,50,000 per hectare”. This price is a pittance compared to the market price for land in the region.What is equally alarming is the fact that the Gujarat government has casually circumvented the entire legal mechanism for environmental and social impact assessment. Environmental clearance required under the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification of September 2006, has not been sought for any component of this elaborate tourism dream project.What becomes abundantly clear from the official website (www.statueofunity.in), is that the statue project is not simply the construction of a “mute monument”. It is an elaborate Tourism Project which includes its principal component, a 182 meter-tall iron statue of Shri Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel built over a project area of more than 120,000 sq.mtrs. surrounded by a man-made lake (reservoir called Garudeshwar Weir); a bridge connecting the statute to the mainland; improved roadway between the Statue and Kevadia village; parking and transport site; and hotel and Convention Centre (Shreshtha Bharat Bhawan).These project components are proposed to be constructed as part of Phase I of the Statue of Unity Project. Phase II of the Project will include the development of banks of River Narmada up to Bharuch District; development of road, rail and tourist infrastructure and tourism corridor from Garudeshwar to Bhadbhut. These are also part of the composite Statue of Unity Project, although the actual project area of this stretch of about 90 km has not yet been revealed to the general public.A serious concern which has been disregarded is that the project site is located on an active tectonic plate in a fault line area which is already burdened with the load of the Sardar Sarovar Dam and its massive reservoir. The construction of the tourism project and other human activities after the completion of the project is bound to have adverse effects on the downstream river, its biodiversity, and the surrounding wetlands all of which has been ignored by the Gujarat government.It is also pertinent that for the world’s tallest statue, the Gujarat government has not even engaged in a Social and Environment Impact Assessment which would shed light on the impact of the project and the resultant influx of migrant labourers and tourists on the livelihoods of the indigenous people who have been residing downstream of the project for generations. Surprisingly, the Gujarat government had allocated Rs 500 crore in the 2014-15 budget and Government of India also had allocated Rs 200 crore in the 2014-15 budget for the Statue of Unity Project by presuming that the Statue of Unity Project does not require environment clearance from the concerned authorities.This was also confirmed by information received in response to our RTI application filed in June 2014 about the environment clearance. The concerned authority clearly states, “Environment Clearance is not required to be obtained; hence Environmental and Social Impact Assessment of the Statue of Unity Project and its contribution to the cumulative impact of all the projects and activities in the area is not carried out.”The Statue of Unity Project will have a widespread impact on the existing infrastructure in the area, land use within a 20 km radius of the project site, flora, fauna, birds and aquatic life due to mechanical structures and lights, aquatic life due to dredging and disposal of dredging materials, surrounding communities due to land acquisition, fishing activity, the existing traffic network due to the influx of tourists and transportation of construction materials, and broadly the air, surface water, groundwater, air, biodiversity, noise and vibrations, socioeconomic status and public health.Other impacts due to quarrying of stones and transportation and also emissions from DG Sets are also expected. The construction is bound to result in damage to the river, riverbed, downstream river, its biodiversity, its active water body, the people living downstream and their livelihoods. The project will also result in displacement of people from Kevadia Village and people of the other areas; the full extent of displacement is not yet known as the planned location of the project’s other components has not been made public.While the Statue of Unity tourism project might be considered as a dream project, in reality, this project is nothing but a project which will rob the home, land and livelihood from the tribals, adversely affect the Narmada river, Shoolpaneshwar Sanctuary, biodiversity of the area, downstream river, and the ecology of the area.The Gujarat government and Modi-led Central government think they can hide behind the 182 meter, towering Statue the full extent of environmental destruction that will be caused by the Statue project. Local citizen’s groups, social movements, democratic rights groups and concerned citizens have already begun tearing down the lies and exposing the casual nature by which the statutory authorities have abdicated their legal and procedural responsibilities as regards obtaining Environmental Clearance, public consultation, and Social Impact Assessment.The statue is symbolic of the model of destructive development which the government is promoting. While evaluating the need for such tourism projects what is required is a holistic approach to development which focuses attention to issues relating to Human Development Index, the Multidimensional Poverty Index and the Composite Development Index. In the absence of such a holistic approach to development, the Modi government will have turned its back on the adivasis of Kevadia Village or the Gujarati “chai wallah” for good.People are determined to fight back `terrorism of tourism’ and assert their fundamental right to live with dignity in their homelands.","Terrorism of tourism: Statue of Unity Project is alliance against environment, life and livelihood of tribals",Pre-Construction
"The Statue of Unity, dedicated to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Gujarat last year. At 182 metres, it is the world’s tallest statue. However, there has been criticism from various quarters over the amount of money spent to build the monument.As the Statue of Unity completed a year of the inauguration on October 31, social media is filled with posts as to how it has turned into a bigger tourist attraction than the Taj Mahal and earned thrice the revenue than the Monument of Love’.Facebook page Global Hindus’ stated some figures to claim that the Statue of Unity attracted more tourists and earned thrice the Taj Mahal’s average annual turnover in 2019. India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading.Taj Mahal statsFacebook page Global Hindus’ has claimed that the Statue of Unity attracted 26 lakh tourists and earned Rs 71.6 crore in 2019. It went on to say that in the last three years, the Taj Mahal’s average annual visitor was 7.50 lakh and the average annual turnover was Rs 22.3 crore. The archived version of the post can be seen here.We found a document of the ministry of culture where all details related to Taj Mahal and other monuments in India can be found. It is basically an answer given in the Lok Sabha on July 8, 2019.According to the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust website, over 28 lakh people visited the Statue of Unity since it was inaugurated on October 31, 2018.advertisementAfter a Google keyword search, we found a report by The Times of India’ which said Rs 71.66 crore was collected through ticket sales.The report, dated October 23, 2019, quoted additional chief secretary, forests & environment, and managing director of Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd (SSNNL) Rajiv Gupta as saying, Sardar Vallabhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust (SVPRET) has already collected Rs 71.66 crore through sale of tickets to tourists. Over 2.6 million tickets have been sold so far.Therefore, it can be said that figures related to Taj Mahal in the viral post is misleading. ",Fact Check: Misleading comparison between Statue of Unity and Taj Mahal goes viral,Post-Construction
"It is well understood that if PM Modi were to advocate breathing tomorrow, his deranged critics would start a campaign against oxygen. When the Statue of Unity, the tallest in the world, was unveiled on Sardar Patel’s birthday last year, it became an instant magnet for naysayers.Their target: the eye-popping cost of building the statue, a hefty Rs 3000 crore. An all-round campaign was run, listing other possible productive uses for the money: primary schools, hospitals and the like. Curiously, not one journalist suggested building a journalism school with the money: it is almost as if they know that their line of work produces no tangible good for society.One of the most widely shared commentaries during this period was by social media-based economist Dhruv Rathee, who produced this estimate for the revenue that the Statue would bring in every year.The Taj Mahal earns Rs 25 crore in revenue a year. Rathee estimated that the Statue of Unity would be lucky to get even 10% of that, suggesting that the Statue would expect to make just about Rs 2.5 crore.Before we get into what actually happened, it is important to understand why such thinking is deeply flawed. The returns on the Statue of Unity cannot be calculated by adding up ticket sales. It has to be calculated on the basis of the total economic value generated.This is simple. Does anyone seriously believe that the Taj Mahal adds just Rs 25 crore to the Indian economy every year? Obviously not. The real return is in terms of the visitors who flock to Agra to see the historic monument, spending on travel, hotels, shopping and eating out.The Statue of Unity does something very similar. Quite cannily, it has been built in the vicinity of the small town of Kevadiya in Gujarat, among mountains and forests. Far from urban centres, which necessitates at least a day of travel to see the place.As many as 26 lakh visitors in 11 months! Imagine how this transforms the economy of Kevadiya, which used to be a town of a few thousand people. Now it caters to food, travel, eating and shopping needs of over 25 lakh people! Think of how much employment and business the brand new tourist attraction has generated.And because social media-based economists would be wondering, how much money did they make in ticket sales?Rs 71.66 crore of ticket sales in 11 months. October was the month of Diwali and Dussehra, so this will go up significantly in the remaining 1 month. But let’s stick to the Rs 71 crore figure.Remember the estimated earnings through ticket sales were a meagre Rs 2.5 crore or less. In other words, the estimate was off by a mere 2700%.Not bad. We can expect more of such expert commentary from liberals in the coming years.This year, the Prime Minister has inaugurated a whole host of new facilities such as river rafting and jungle safari at the spot, which will bring in even more people, make them stay longer and spend more.Clearly, the Statue of Unity is a hit. The amazing publicity generated around the Statue has worked. Liberals should concede that.Yes, the investment of Rs 3000 crore was a risk. But every investment involves risk. Without risk, there would be no wealth creation. There would only be social media-based economists who have nothing at stake.",How the Statue of Unity proved naysayers to be 2700% wrong,Post-Construction

"Days after its inauguration, the much-hyped Statue of Unity has been engulfed in controversy over its funding. A viral post claims that Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) were made to shell out nearly Rs 2,500 crore as their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) fund for the construction of the statue. The post was brought to the notice of the India Today Fact Check team by a reader, Hilda Abraham.Social media is indeed abuzz with claims that PSUs spent over Rs 2,525 crore for the construction of the statue. India Today Fact Check team found that the PSUs have contributed funds for the statue but the claims regarding the amount are highly exaggerated. The biggest contribution came from the Gujarat government followed by the Centre.One David D'Costa posted a message on Facebook claiming that most of the funding for the project was made by public sector oil companies. One of the sentences in the message reads: ""When India is literally crying for reduction in Oil prices...This is how our Oil sector PSUs are made to splurge their money!""The message, being widely circulated on social media, quotes Loksatta editor Girish Kuber for figures regarding PSUs footing the bill of the Sardar Patel statue. Kuber wrote an article in Marathi daily, Loksatta, on November 3 quoting the figures.Some other posts on social media even claim that a loan of Rs 3,600 crore was taken from China to make the statue.To find out the details of the contribution made by the PSUs, India Today Fact Check team went through the annual reports of various PSUs and the budget papers.The Sardar Patel statue project was first announced on October 7, 2010, by the then Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi. But it wasn't until 2013, when a Special Purpose Vehicle, the Sardar Vallabhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust was formed that it gathered pace.After Modi became the prime minister in 2014, the project gathered momentum. The central government in its 2014-15 Budget allocated a sum of Rs 200 crore to the Gujarat government for this purpose.Since then, the Gujarat government has been making a provision for funds for the statue in the state budget.In the meantime, several PSUs also started contributing funds for the statue which did not go down well with the Comptroller & Auditor General (CAG). The CAG in its Compliance Audit on General Purpose Financial Reports 2018 of Central Public Sector Enterprises of Union Government rapped the PSU firms for spending CSR funds on the construction of the statue. The CAG report stated that a total of Rs 146.83 crore was spent by five PSU firms namely ONGC, IOCL, BPCL, HPCL and OIL.Since, the claims made on the basis of Loksatta article do not mention any time frame for the CSR funding for the project, it was difficult to verify the years they were referring to. However, we decided to look into the annual reports of these PSUs since 2015, the year the construction work for the statue gained momentum.For ONGC, the claim made was for Rs 500 crore. But according to the annual report, it has spent only Rs 50 crore from its CSR fund for the project.In the viral post, it is claimed that all the three companies -- BPCL, OIC and GAIL -- have spent Rs 250 crore each for the statue. India Today found that BPCL spent Rs 45 crore, OIC Rs 25 crore and GAIL Rs 25 crore. Power Grid has contributed Rs 12.5 crore against a claim of Rs 125 crore made in the post.The Loksatta article mentioned that the HPCL has given Rs 250 crore but we found that as per annual report of 2016-17, it gave Rs 25 crore.The claims stated that Gujarat Minerals Corporation Limited (GMCL) had given Rs 100 crore for the project whereas India Today found from the annual report that the company gave only Rs 11 crore.The post claims that the two companies, Petronet and Balmer Lawrie, have given Rs 50 crore each for the statue project, but we found that Petronet gave Rs 5 crore while Balmer Lawrie gave money twice -- Rs 62 lakh in 2017-18 and Rs 38 lakh in 2016-17.We couldn't find any mention of funds for the statue in the financial statements of Engineers India Limited.India Today contacted Sandeep Kumar, joint managing director at the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL), for further clarification on the project funding. The SSNNL has been tasked with overseeing the implementation of the Statue of Unity project. According to Kumar, the project cost was Rs 2,362 crore, and an additional Rs 650 crore has been kept for the maintenance of the project for the next 15 years. The project cost includes setting up of a memorial, a 50-room hotel, and infrastructure surrounding the area.Kumar claimed that ""the central government had given Rs 300 crore for the project while Rs 550 crore was given by the central and state PSUs, private companies and individuals as donations"".""Rest of the expenditure has been borne by the Gujarat government,"" he added.India Today Fact Check team found that the claims, which said the PSUs bore the cost of Sardar Patel statue project, are partially true. The PSUs certainly did not spend to the tune Rs 2,500 crore as being claimed.

Soon, Congress-friendly journalists and Congress supporters took to Twitter to spread misinformation and to demand that the Statue of Unity, world’s tallest statue in honour of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, be dismantled.The Wire columnist asked whether the Statue of Unity will be dismantled for the economic boycott of China. Is Statue of Unity made in ChinaThe ‘Statue of Unity’, the tallest statue in the world built as a tribute to one of India’s greatest leaders – Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel – was actually constructed by the engineering major Larsen & Toubro (L&T) in India and not in China.According to the reports, the ‘Statue of Unity’ is a three-layered statue. The first and the inner-most layer has two 127-metre-high towers made of reinforced cement concrete. The second layer has been constructed using a steel mesh. Both of these layers were made in India.The third, which is the outermost layer, has been done using a bronze cladding, which carries intricate details of Patel’s clothes, posture and facial expressions. It is this layer of the statue which was built in China.Most importantly, when the construction of the statue began, the builders found out that none of the 15 major bronze foundries in India was capable of building these claddings. The construction giant L&T then initiated a global tender to identify a partner to build the cladding.Finally, the China-based Jiangxi Toqine Metal Crafts Corporation, which is the world’s largest foundry, was given the work of production of around 7,000 bronze plates and panels of various sizes.This bronze cladding work, reportedly, forms only 9 per cent of the total value of the project. “The entire statue itself is being built in India at the site and only the bronze cladding in the form of bronze plates is being sourced from China, which constitutes a negligible amount of less than 9 per cent of the total value of the project,” the company had stated in 2015.Secondly, according to an Indian Express report, of the total 4,076 labours working at the site of the statue in two shifts, only 200 workers were from China. The labours who worked in batches for two-three months each since September 2017, were part of a team consisting a thousand workers, who were employed for cladding work. Hence, it forms only 5 per cent of the total workforce involved in erecting the Statue of Unity.A statue which has been built with over 95 per cent of India’s workforce and also 90 per cent of the statue’s work was done by companies belonging to India.But Congress supporters’ dislike for Sardar Patel does not let them see beyond this.Ladakh standoffAbout 5000 Chinese army personnel, under the garb of a military exercise, diverted their movement towards the Indian side of the LAC (Line of Actual Control).

"On 31 October India will unveil the world's tallest statue, which has cost hundreds of millions of dollars. BBC Gujarati's Roxy Gagdekar spoke to local farmers who say they are aghast that the government has spent so much money on it while they struggle to make ends meet.For years Vijendra Tadvi, a 39-year-old farmer in the western state of Gujarat, has been struggling to find water to irrigate his three acres (1.2 hectares) of farmland.He grows chilli, corn and groundnuts. Like millions of farmers across India, he relies on monsoon rains to water his crops. or he pumps out groundwater, which supports 80% of the rural water supply and farm irrigation. But long dry summers followed by erratic rains have led to frequent drought and shrunk the incomes of farmers like Mr Tadvi.So in 2015, Mr Tadvi found a job as a driver on a construction site to supplement his income. The Gujarat state government was building a 182m (600ft) high statue, billed as the tallest in the world.The bronze-clad tribute to Indian independence leader Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel cost 29.9bn rupees (£330m; $430m). And Gujarat's government is reported to have paid more than half of that amount. The remainder came from the federal government or public donations.""Instead of spending money on a giant statue, the government should have used it for farmers in the district,"" Mr Tadvi said, adding that farmers in the area still lack basic irrigation facilities.The statue is complete and Mr Tadvi has found more work as a driver on construction sites. But he is still unimpressed by the government's largesse.The ""statue of unity"", as it is known, is the centrepiece of a sprawling memorial to Patel. A formidable nationalist leader, he was born in Gujarat and went on to become independent India's first interior minister and deputy prime minister under Jawaharlal Nehru.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is also from Gujarat, commissioned the statue when he was the state's chief minister in 2010. In recent years, Mr Modi's ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has embraced Patel in an attempt to claim his legacy - and they have accused the opposition Congress party of sidelining him to benefit Nehru's descendants, three of whom have served as prime ministers.Congress ruled India for 49 of its 71 years as an independent nation.The plan for Patel's memorial includes a three-star hotel, a museum and a research centre that will focus on subjects ""close to his heart"" - such as ""good governance"" and ""agriculture development"".All of this is about 10km (6.2 miles) from Mr Tadvi's village, Nana Pipaliya, in the largely poor, rural and tribal Narmada district. Many of its households continue to live in hunger, primary school enrolment has been falling and malnourishment persists, according to a report published in 2016 by the state government.image captionFarmers are increasingly protesting over loan waivers and crop pricesBut the government believes the memorial will boost the district's economy, as they expect about 2.5 million annual visitors. ""It will lead to employment opportunities for locals and will also increase tourism in the area,"" said Sandeep Kumar, a senior official involved with the project.Locals are sceptical. ""We want to ask the government: why can't they fund a project to support farmers and improve their standard of life?"" said Lakhan, a tribal activist who only goes by his first name. ""We were promised water for irrigation but the situation remains the same.""Nana Pipaliya is in what is known as a ""command area"" of a nearby dam - lands that are supposed to receive water from a designated irrigation project. But, Mr Tadvi said, he and other farmers were still deprived of water.""I grow only one crop per year, while people with irrigation facilities grow up to three crops annually,"" said Bhola Tadvi, a farmer who relies solely on rainwater for irrigation.According to the 2011 census, some 85% of the district's working population is engaged in agriculture, a sector which is dominated by small farmers who own two to four acres of land.District officials told BBC Gujarati that the government was committed to ensuring that water was made available to them. Lakhan said thousands of farmers were struggling to access water for irrigation.image captionFarmers regularly suffer heavy losses caused by droughtHalf of India's population works on farms, but farming contributes only 15% to the country's GDP.In fact, agriculture growth in India has dwindled to 1.2%. Farms employ a lot of people but produce too little, and tens of thousands of farmers struggle to repay crop loans taken from banks and money lenders.Earlier this year, farmers in the neighbouring state of Maharashtra staged a massive protest demanding a waiver on the repayment of loans and better prices for their crops.In 2017, farmers from drought-affected districts in the southern state of Tamil Nadu brandished human skulls and a held live mice between their teeth to draw attention to their plight.Here in the shadow of Patel's statue, farmers have resorted to stealing water. They say they can see the water passing by their farms through a canal that transports it from the dam, but it's illegal to divert the water so they are forced to steal it.One of the farmers said he had laid a pipe underground from the canal to his farm, adding that nearly all farmers in the area did this to survive.""We don't have any option but to take the water illegally as there are no sources of water left for us.""     ",Indian farmers fume at $430m cost of Gujarat statue,Pre-Construction
"With the countdown to the inauguration of world's tallest statue—Statue of Unity—in Gujarat on October 31 having begun, the controversy over the manner in which the statue has come up and the issue of allegedly ignoring rights of local tribals have intensified.A two-pronged attack on the BJP government in Gujarat and Prime Minister Narendra Modi came on Friday, on the day the party flagged off the Ekta Yatra from Bardoli.If former Gujarat chief minister Suresh Mehta, under the aegis of Rashtra Manch (Gujarat), alleged that the statue of Sardar Patel was politically motivated with an eye on 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the Congress leaders urged the BJP to also keep at the statue site the details of the history as to why Patel had banned the RSS. Earlier in the day, Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani had alleged that the Gandhi family had always ignored Patel.The 182-metre tall statue is coming up at Kevadia Colony, three kilometres away from Sardar Sarovar Project (SSP) dam site, at a cost of Rs 3,000 crore. Without naming Modi, Mehta, at a press conference attended by local tribals, too, alleged that the statue was built only for Modi's personal ambitions. Citing several instances of how the SSP had helped the BJP in the assembly elections in Gujarat and 2014 Lok Sabha election, Mehta also gave out details about how the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited diverted funds from the project. Mehta also remarked that the CAG in its report had observed that it was inappropriate for the public sector undertakings to give funds for the statue. The CAG had also noted that building of the statue did not fall in the CSR activity of the public sector oil companies that donated money.Mehta reminded the BJP how it had reacted to Congress president Rahul Gandhi's remarks that the statue was Chinese made. The former chief minister said that L&T had given the sub-contract to a Chinese firm and the state government had said that it had no control over whom the L&T gives contract to. Meanwhile, local tribals, who have been demanding Narmada waters and land for the land that has gone for the project, have given a call for hartal in the entire tribal belt from Ambaji in north Gujarat to Umargaon in south Gujarat to protest against the state government's alleged failure to protect the culture and other interests of the tribals. In an open letter to Modi, the tribals have said that he is not welcome to the state for the inauguration of the statue. The tribals alleged that the BJP was giving false promises to the tribals and they have not got benefit of the Narmada waters for which their parents had sacrificed their land. Tribal rights activist Laxman Musafir said that around 70 villages are being affected by the Statue of Unity, Shresth Bharat Bhavan and other amenities that are to come up in the area. Another social activist, Dr Praful Tadvi, alleged that the statue would be disastrous for the tribals. Tadvi, a tribal, said that in the tribal areas the education ratio is very poor. Business is being done in the name of Sardar Patel, he said.Meanwhile, the Ekta Yatra of the BJP, aimed at spreading the message of unity and the efforts made by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, is expected to go to 10,000 villages of the state. In the first phase, the yatra will cover over 5,000 villages.",Row over Statue of Unity intensifies as BJP faces tribal ire,Pre-Construction
"Respected Sardar Patelji, Namaskar!Wherever you may be, as our leader of the Freedom Movement, your soul, I know, rests here on the motherland whose beloved son you have always been. Your act of freeing India from the shackles of royal states and estates and of freeing the farmers from the oppressive tax laws of the British regime is unprecedented even to this day. As the first home minister of the first government of Independent India, your firm, non-communal and social approach to the unparalleled violence and the relief work thereafter, was appreciated by none else than Mahatmaji as unique, despite the controversy created by some.You stood tall in the historical freedom struggle of India as Sardar. But you know, while throwing your legacy by the way side, a 182 meter-high statue of yours is being unveiled in a few days to be the tallest in the world! Can you imagine who has built your new avatar? Many Chinese and some local Adivasi and national labourers have worked overnight on the ‘Sadhu Bet’, a hillock with Adivasi deity of their faith. You would surely ask, on whose land would this statue stand? Whose plan was this? This land, river, forest that your avatar is going to stand on, belongs to Adivasis. The very same people your government and then leaders, Mahatma to Pandit Nehru recognised as villagers with rights, as republics and offered security through Panchsheel. The forefathers of the Indian Constitution, with Babasaheb at the helm, also granted them right to peace and good government, through the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution and later, the PESA Act towards self-reliance.You would surely watch from the highland, the scene down into the River Narmada and its banks to the basin wide and far. Your vision will find their huts and hamlets in the hills and hillocks one of which was Varata Bawa Tekri under your feet. Do remember the days when you carried out the operation to integrate the princely states with delicacy and democracy, to make most of them sacrifice voluntarily for unity. By the way, your avatar is also claimed to be for the same goal, unity…yet with the insanity of impinging upon not just their land but also their rights. Would you ever think of using ‘force’ against these simple and least monetised, self-reliant people, as had to be done against the princely state of Junagadh then?Sardar, these Adivasis also belong to the farming community you recognised as the contributors who feed and need to lead. Today, if only you know the reasons behind their laying life and cuddling death, you would have taken to the same task and struggle, combing villages and fields as in August 1942. But the most shocking for you, who acquired royal properties, dealt with transfers, created ‘privy purses,’ would be to know the ways and means of transferring today the life supporting resources of the very brethren you fought for, receiving acclaim for the social movement you built. Non-cooperation was the non-violent tool you exercised, under the guidance of Bapu then.The same tool is now a weapon in the hands of the Indian rulers, practising neo-colonial ideals. They do not bring in the horses or the Sepoys or take over properties of the rich and the mighty. They take over the very life line: land, water, river, forest and fish of the weak and the marginalised. Could you ever dream of the Indian State – the ICS cadres who you were treated as the ‘Patron Saint’ of, and the cabinet members, you warned against ‘partiality and corruptibility’ and incited against a path of rectitude in your speech on April 21, 1947 – assuming itself to be powerful enough to not only tax farmers but also exploit them through low prices for the produce and extract GST from small traders and evict the market infrastructure of the poor, the hawkers, in the name of huge, gigantic infrastructure? Is your legacy at stake, Sardar? How could they tolerate suicides by lakhs of farmers?Do please have a look on your left and you will find the six-lane highway running up to 120 km in length parallel to Narmada. Lakhs of trees, more than 100-years-old, within the last year had to make way for this highway. People of Rajpipla, once a princely state that is recorded in history for having defeated Aurangzeb’s forces are compelled to be mute spectators, having no channel to vent their Mann ki Baat.You, Sardar, once the chairman of the committees responsible for minorities, tribals, excluded areas and fundamental rights must also know that when your avatar will be well lit and decorated, the tribal communities, being repressed and oppressed, are to be thrown into darkness. Their lands, in six villages not even legally acquired, following British law of 1894, but simply taken over, paying a paltry sum of Rs 80 to Rs 200 per acre in 1961, are now being diverted for luxurious hotels named after ‘Shreshtha Bharath’ or Swaminarayan Complex and even a museum with their own remnants.You, who were successful in recovering the farmlands for the farmers refusing to pay the oppressive tax would come down to support these tribals who are not granted anything as per the new law of 2013, nor are gifted with alternative land but are being made to accept a Rs 7 lakh package which they too are non-cooperating with. You were at the forefront of such a struggle and having threatened to leave Congress, had made your party accept the path of non-violent yet militant battle that led you into jail in 1940 and a solid mass protest in 1942, with shutdown of none less than civil services! With your ability to organise the countrymen as also to face the onslaught of the imperialist forces, you could certainly challenge the present powers, the creators of your avatar, vouching for unity, but practising divide and rule tactics and promoting or allowing brutality, while denying diversity of creed, culture and religion.Kripalani (L) with Sardar Vallabhai Patel and Manibehn Patel. Credit: Wikimedia CommonsIf only you would take a step forward and downward into the valley of Narmada, you would surely be overwhelmed with the simplicity of these nature-based generations-old communities, of Adivasis, farmers and fishworkers. Many of them had already lost their lands as it was acquired by the state for the Dam, again in your name, Sardar Sarovar, without paying them compensation worth a rupee. They too walked in your steps, faced attacks, and were sent to jails. (Jail? You had called it a ‘place for peace’, in 1943, remember?) The government in 2013 issued orders and made promises to give land for land. But ultimately they are being cheated and evicted out of their balance land for tourism! Do please have an eye on these fast track operations around, as only you can stop them from further damage…only you can!Sardar, the scale and impact of forcible encroachment upon the lives of the communities in this most ancient Narmada civilisation and the valley, can be seen by someone of your stature and perspective. No one can hold your hand today, but you could and would drag the sena/army of bureaucrats out of their villages with your ‘iron hand’ if only you witnessed their might against the toilers’ rights. Will you, our beloved leader, engage the powers that be in a thorough review and reflection? Gone are the days when yourself and Gandhiji had such a discourse on the floor of the jail and evolved a vision of swaraj and self-reliance, of agriculture and village republics. Gone are the days when you valued production by masses to ensure equity in both the economy and the social life.I feel ashamed to tell you that there was no need to bring in 1,500 Chinese workers here while excluding local adivasis from Gujarat, your own state, many of whom are compelled to migrate and harvest sugarcane, working day and night. I feel shaken to share with you what is being planned and publicised in your name… Shopping malls, five or seven star hotels, luxurious guest houses, helipads, statewise bhavans on the river bank with all its paraphernalia the shops, markets, massive food plaza, food courts, walk ways, travelators and what not. All this when not less than 35,000 families, affected by the Dam in your name since years, are still awaiting full, fair and just rehabilitation.  They never marketised Narmada, nor its water. They are damned by the Dam but are most awed and anguished to see their sacrifice being taken as a capital for the tourism industry and as everyone knows, political tourism too. They are sad that the farmers of Gujarat, the progeny of your movements are left high and dry… while the corporates reap huge benefits.Your contribution to the farmers and vision of India are enshrined with that of Mahatmaji and Nehru in all our memories. You accepted Panditji, and vowed for unity within Congress. The common citizens of this country have no place in this gigantic play today, Sardar. All lights will be on you, the avatar, Sardar, while throwing everything that you practised and preached is intentionally left to the dark recesses of history books and the future of the Adivasis and this country is being sealed with the new paradigm.Your generation was aware of two vices – corruption and communalism. The spirit behind your then sermons is needed today. Your NO to communalism reflected in your appeal to the religious leaders during communal violence following the partition that was inevitable. Your speeches across India and a letter to Golwalkar Guruji against the Hindu fundamentalist vision of RSS asking them to change and get integrated, is to be read and imbibed by every citizen of the country today. Those who are hiding behind your new Avatar, and marketing you, have never engaged themselves to understand your thoughts and your action to over come violence, to move from monarchies to democracy, from monopoly and hegemony to equity and fraternity. They do not visit the families of those lynched by mobs. They do not respect the resolutions of the adivasis. They do not value agriculture or the agriculturists.  But they are staking a claim to your name, Sardar.They hail the tallness of your Avatar while they are consumed in their own pettiness. Adivasis know all this. Evicted since 1961, the Adivasis can’t take it anymore. No Jaykaras ! No celebrations from them. They mourn, they protest, they condemn and challenge as they know their mother river, not just gods and goddesses but culture and nature, and their very life is threatened again and again. Their forefathers too had fought the British, and with their perseverance had held on to land then. They are in a new freedom struggle, asserting self-determination. They are not a part of this game in your name, worth Rs. 3,500 crores with about 200 crores illegally collected from public enterprises as CSR, as per a CAG report. What is CSR ? That will be for another letter on another day Sardar…Your avatar shall stand tall, Sardar. In the midst of the river, on the Varata Bawa Tekri. We watch with hope that your Avatar shall watch over and stop all that is unjust, against unity, equity and sustainability. We seek the blessings and support of your iron hand for today and for ever. We look forward to having you there when adivasis raise their voice, amidst festive tourists who will gather on the 31st and everyday, with or without your legacy, but all vows for a new touristocracy. We know you alone will listen to the adi-vasis, their cry halt, inspiring them to fight for their rights and the Mother River’s too !.

"India is now home to the world’s tallest statue, a tribute to one of its tallest leaders. But was the statue even made in India? If critics of the project are to be believed, it was shipped out of China in 2018. And it doesn’t end here. To some, it is also unclear whether the structure was built by Indian or Chinese workers.These questions were raised for the first time in 2015, when work on the project began. And despite engineering major Larsen & Toubro (L&T), the firm executing the project, clarifying on multiple occasions, Congress President Rahul Gandhi claimed last month that the statue was being built in China.",Was The Statue Of Unity Really Made In China?

The construction cost could have been used to irrigate 40,192 hectares of land, cover repair, renovation & restoration of 162 minor irrigation schemes and the construction of 425 small check-dams.The Statue of Unity--representing the symbolic unification of India post-Independence--will be unveiled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 31, 2018, as tribute to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on his 143rd birth anniversary. The statue is now the world’s tallest at 182 metres (597 feet) or nearly 100 times taller than someone 6 feet tall.Sardar Patel -- independent India’s first deputy prime minister and home minister--was popularly known as the ‘Iron Man of India’ for his role in bringing about the merger of the princely states post-independence.Resentment among farmers and localsThousands of tribals and farmers in Gujarat are planning a mass protest against the unveiling of the statue. They are unhappy with the cost of the project and with the lack of adequate rehabilitation efforts and water shortages in the catchment area where the statue is located.The statue’s construction has affected 75,000 tribals across 72 villages in Gujarat’s Narmada district, NDTV reported on October 20, 2018. Of these villages, 32 have been most affected.In 19 villages, rehabilitation has allegedly not been complete while compensation has been paid but further commitments like land and jobs have not been fulfilled in 13 villages.Farmers have also threatened to drown themselves in the Narmada river as protest during the statue’s unveiling event, The Indian Express reported on October 29, 2018.Resentment has also been building among more than 1,500 farmers in four districts—Chhota Udepur, Panchmahals, Vadodara and Narmada— who had sold 262,000 tonne sugarcane to the Sardar Sugar Mill in Sankheda, which was shut down due to financial mismanagement by board members. They are still waiting for their dues amounting to Rs 12 crore.“At a time when Gujarat is facing a water crisis due to lower availability in the Narmada dam, I think the statue project could have been postponed by a year,” according to Ghanshyam Shah, a political expert based in Gujarat Mint reported on October 30, 2018.Vijendra Tadvi, a farmer in Gujarat has been finding it difficult to irrigate his three acre farm, the BBC reported on October 28, 2018. ""Instead of spending money on a giant statue, the government should have used it for farmers in the district,"" he said.Here’s what Rs 2,989 crore spent on the statue is worth:Over eight times the amount (Rs 365 crore) allotted to Gujarat by the central government in 2017-18 under the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (National Agriculture Development Scheme) as well as nearly five times the amount (Rs 602 crore) approved by the state government for 56 new schemes and 32 continuous projects under the scheme.More than double the estimated cost (Rs 1,090 crore) of two water pipeline projects. Firstly, a project based on the Kadana reservoir that will irrigate 10,000 hectare in Dahod and Mahisagar districts. Second, the Dinod-Boridra lift irrigation project which will provide irrigation to 1,800 hectare within Surat district.More than double the estimated amount (Rs 1,114 crore) for proposals submitted to the central government by the Gujarat government to include in Pradhanmantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (Prime Ministers Agriculture Irrigation Scheme). The projects will irrigate 40,192 hectares of land, cover the repair, renovation & restoration of 162 minor irrigation schemes and the construction of 425 small check-dams.    The statue construction cost could build:Two new IIT campuses (considering one IIT campus costs Rs 1,167 crore).Two AIIMS campuses (considering one AIIMS cost Rs 1,103 crore).Five new permanent IIM campuses (considering one IIM campus costs Rs 539 crore).Five new solar power plants, each producing 75 megawatts of power (considering one power plant costs Rs 528 crore).Six Mars missions (considering one mission costs Rs 450 crore) and three Chandrayaan-2 (Moon) missions (considering one mission costs Rs 800 crore) by the Indian Space Research Organisation.World’s tallest statue with state of art technologyThe Statue of Unity is now 29 metres taller than the Spring Temple Buddha in China-- which at 153 metres was previously the tallest statue in the world--and twice the height of the Statue of Liberty (93 metres) in the United States.The Veera Abhaya Anjaneya Hanuman Swami in Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, was previously the tallest statue (41 meters or 135 feet) in India.“The Statue [Of Unity] will not only remind every individual of our great nation's freedom struggle but will also inspire the people of our country to inculcate Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's visionary ideologies of unity, patriotism, inclusive growth and good governance,” the project portal reads under its objectives.",Statue Of Unity: The World’s Tallest But Here’s What It Could Have Paid For,Pre-Construction
"Controversy continues to surround the Rs.2,989 crore Statue of Unity in Gujarat. A public interest petition has been filed against land acquisition around the statue. The High Court of Gujarat has ordered status quo and put a stop to eviction of people until further notice.The Ahmedabad-based environmentalist Mahesh Pandya had filed the PIL in the High Court of Gujarat against the land acquisition in six villages around the Statue of Unity in Narmada district. In his PIL Pandya said the government and the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL) were set to evict more than 5,000 Adivasis “under the guise of tourism development projects without following due procedure under the Land Acquisition Act”. Furthermore, he said, the authorities were asserting their rights over these lands by claiming that the lands had been acquired in the 1960s itself but since there was no need for the lands then people had been allowed to settle there.Mahesh Pandya’s PIL said that whatever claim the government might have had on the land should have lapsed over this period of time. “The proceedings of the land acquisition lapsed long back and the respondents cannot claim to evict these villagers from different parcels of land which, though shown in the name of SSNNL or government, are in actual and physical possession of the tribal villagers,” the petition stated. Despite this the government and its agency have started the process of taking possession of the land.The statue has been a magnet for controversy right from its conception to its inauguration. It was initially supposed to be a memorial to Patel but soon also became a focal point for promoting the BJP’s brand of nationalism. The 182-metre-tall colossus was meant to celebrate the eponymous and equally gigantic Sardar Sarovar dam which is located just a few kilometres from the statue. For those who opposed the dam this was a double insult since the construction of the Sardar Sarovar dam and its supporting dams displaced thousands of people and then the statue construction did the same. From being representative of nationalism, progress and free trade, the statue is now promoted as a tourist attraction. Hence the desire to take over more land and create more tourism facilities.Accusations of environmental devastation and loss of land and livelihood are met with the argument that tourism is sustainable development and promoting it helps local cultures and local livelihood earnings. Furthermore, the very nationalistic claims of the statue are undermined given the fact that the 5,000 tonnes of iron, 75,000 cubic metres of concrete, 5,700 tonnes of steel and 22,500 tonnes of bronze sheets that went into the making of the statue were largely fabricated and fashioned in China and erected by Chinese labour.The shifting shadows of the statue’s politics also include its funding. The Gujarat government had initially said that it would be funded by private and public money, but finally it was the State government that footed most of the bill.",Gujarat High Court halts land acquisition around Statue of Unity ,Post-Construction
"‘Statue of Unity’, designed by Ram V Sutar was inaugurated by Mr. Modi the Prime Minister of India on the occasion of the Rashtriya Ekta Diwas, at Kevadiya, in Narmada District of Gujarat on October 31, 2018, the statue as viewed on 31 October 2018 The Statue of Unity, a colossal statue, the world’s tallest - 182 metres (597 ft.)tall, costing ₹2,989 crore (US$420 million), of Indian statesman and independence activist Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel inthe state of Gujarat, located on a river island facing the Sardar Sarovar Dam on the river Narmada was inaugurated by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 31 October 2018, the 143rd anniversary of Patel&#39;s birth. It was built within three-and-a-half years by an army of over 3,000 workers, including 300 engineers from infrastructure major Larsen &amp; Toubro (L&amp;T).Does a poor country like India need statues like this- a country where farmers continue to perish and tribals are protesting? A country where youth is unemployed, this mere political symbol with not much to add to the historically rich culture of India – is it not a symbol of irony.The finances involved are contentious, all Indians are worried and wondering why local farmers who are unhappy and suffering were ignored and that the Make in India slogan sounds hollow now given the external panels of the statue were made in China and the CAG has raised questions about CSR money being used for the purpose, but here we are, with a structure that is the ‘tallest statue in the world’; there is nothing that we Indians love more than making it to the Guinness Book of Records and this one certainly will. Did the PM of India forget that he is a PM of a poor country and that we cannot especially at this moment of time when we need to spend all our money on our basic necessities, education, infrastructure development, house, food, roads, and other such amnesties? Much of this money could have gone on the welfare of our people.Apart from the sheer vanity of erecting a tall edifice and boasting about its height, Modi is using this statute as a theme to run his election the importance of a strong, decisive man in the center to keep the nation strong and steer it towards its manifest destiny. The PM only wants Patel’s image and not his message, of coming down on communal forces and lawless elements who provoke violence in the name of religion, or his ability to work with other tall leaders despite his differences with them.What is the use of the statue if the people on the land have to suffer and are moved from their homes? The area is home to mostly tribal groups with special protected status. The building andinauguration also sparked protests from local communities who say they were not compensated for the land used to erect the statue. The chiefs of 22 local villages signed a letter calling on Modi to stay away from the inauguration, the posters were torn and their faces blackened. Many foreign politicians have criticised Modi government saying that it is foolishness to borrow a large amount of money and then spend it on making statues, they have also gone on to say that India no longer needs to be funded. The Tory parliamentarian added, ""It is up to them how they spend their money but if they can afford this statue, then it is clearly a country we should not need to be giving aid to."" But on the other hand, if we look at the positive points of building the statue it has given India an image of a progressive country. Indians can cash this image by inviting more foreign investors to invest in India, which will mean more cash flow, which will ultimately increase the GDP of India. At the same time, it has also added up to the aesthetic value. The statue can be viewed by many Indians as a symbol of pride for the nation. This can be a reason for us, Indians to commemorate the contributions of many freedom fighters in the freedom struggle and post-independence issues. The construction of this statue also ensured employment to the local workers, which ultimately helped in the development of the area. Revenue generating Initial response has been phenomenal; with over 1 lakh people visited it in the first 10 days. That makes the average of about 10000 people in one day. And the ticket being 350 per person the revenue generation has already begun. It is true that a statue in honor of Sardar Vallabhbhai is the least we can do. It will be a great tourism site which has and will continue to generate jobs. It has also projected to the world that India is economically enough prosperous to fund such a huge project. And also the statue will act as a symbol of unity but was it just Sardar who tried to unite India, it would have been great if a monument was to be built in memory of all freedom fighters in general by not naming any, just like how war memorials are built.",Statue of Unity- a controversy or pride?,Post-Construction

When the British decided to leave, he had the unenviable task of uniting the disparate 562 princely states that were deeply divided on religious and cultural lines. Gifted with Kautilya’s brain, Patel understood how important it was to bring the princely states together, more importantly, he also knew how to go about it.There was hard political bargaining involved and only someone with a strong political will could have done it. Fortunately for India, there was Patel.Unfortunately, India had so far not accorded the leader his full due, neither in the political discourse, nor in terms of symbolism. By giving him the world’s highest statue, India has finally moved closer to honouring the legend the way he should have been.It Unites PeopleScrap metal from about 600,000 villages under the Loha Campaign from across India.  This is the tribute that Sardar Patel would have cherished the most – metal collected from across the entire country that he unified has now been used to create his due place on the global stage.",4 Reasons India’s Controversial Statue of Unity is Iconic,Post-Construction
"We love to trivialise and dispute everything, which is why we are a criticism surplus society. For a democracy this isn’t necessarily a bad thing. But sometimes we take our disagreements or disagreeableness too far. As with the monument to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, inaugurated by PM Modi on October 31, which we can justifiably vaunt as the world’s tallest statue. But there is an irony to the largely uncalled for controversy over this tribute to the unifier of India. Should the Statue of Unity itself have become a topic for discord and disunity? Surely not.Let us recall how Patel, at the helm of States Department, saved the day for India. From its formation in June 1947, the Department’s mandate was to negotiate soon-to-be-independent India’s relationship with the motley conglomeration of the over 555-odd Princely States that formed nearly half the area and over one-fourth the population of the sub-continent. To integrate them was a gargantuan task. The best tribute to Patel’s superb abilities and masterly control of the situation came from none other than his mentor, Mahatma Gandhi: “The problem of the states is so difficult that YOU alone can solve it.” Patel not only saved India from fragmentation, but incorporated even the smallest, weakest, or most reluctant territory into body politic of sovereign India. If the nation has at long last honoured him with the world’s tallest statue, isn’t this in the fitness of things?The mammoth Statue of Unity stands 182 m. (nearly 600 ft) tall, overlooking the rolling hills and the sacred waters of the Narmada. Twice the height of the iconic Statue of Lady in the New York harbour, it has been meticulously designed by the 93-year old master sculptor Ram Sutar. It displaces the 128 m. (420 ft.) Spring Temple Buddha in Lushan, China, as the world’s tallest statue. Erected through a public-private initiative at the cost of nearly Rs 2,400 crore, the statue was announced by Modi in October 2013, when he was Chief Minister of Gujarat. He has now fulfilled his promise as India’s Prime Minister.  250 engineers and 3400 workers took over 42 months to turn the PM’s dream into a reality. The viewing gallery at 153 metres (500 ft) can take 200 visitors at a time, offering panoramic views of the Sardar Sarovar dam and the surrounding Satpura and Vindhyachal ranges. The museum, sound and light show, theme park, and shopping mall, hotels and tent cities are added attractions. At Rs. 350 per person per entrance, there is no doubt that the monument will attract millions of visitors.So what if the statue cost a considerable amount of money? It is sure to generate tourist dollars and rupees, besides creating employment for thousands. In addition, it will be an inspiring public monument to the nation, something all of us can be proud of. Naysayers have in the past have similarly objected to our space programme, not to mention the bullet train. But they discount the monument’s symbolic value. As Modi said, “This statue is an answer to all those who question India’s power and might.” Washington D.C., the capital of the United States, also boasts of major monuments to the nation, which have now become an indispensable part of every visitor’s itinerary.The protests by farmers and “tribals,” the latter specially marked out by our Left-Liberal media, are only to be expected, especially as they are likely to be politically motivated. Actually, all those displaced by the Statue have reportedly been generously compensated. Those who charge that the BJP doesn’t have “a past to invoke” are also surely mistaken. Patel doesn’t belong to any one political party, but the whole nation. Certainly, the Congress, marginalised and undermined his legacy can only rue their own miscalculation and meanness today, now that the BJP has stolen a march over them. Similarly, to complain that the BJP will gain politically by the Statue ahead of the 2019 general elections is also senseless. Why shouldn’t the ruling party benefit by this colossus that captures the public’s imagination and dominates the state’s political landscape? So what if the bronze cladding of the statue is made in China? Large portions of most of everything we use today is made in China. This is a reality regardless of patriotic sentiments. But, for the record, less than 10 per cent of the structure is actually imported from that country. Finally, the gleeful mud-raking over the Statue in the foreign press is only to be expected. Let us gloat instead on how every major newspaper in the world was forced to cover the event. That’s what happens when you make something that is the tallest, biggest, best—or first. We should aspire to do that more often.",Why the Statue of Unity must not be the cause of disunity,Post-Construction

"The world’s tallest statue is located in Gujarat, India. Standing almost 600 feet tall, the Statue of Unity depicts Indian freedom fighter and politician Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, one of the most prominent leaders of the Indian independence movement, and the first Deputy Prime Minister of India. Brought to fruition by Michael Graves & Associates in collaboration with Turner Construction and Meinhardt Group, the memorial took around 4 years to design and construct.Here are 10 standout facts about this epic construction, including some mind-boggling statistics on the architectural materials used in construction…1. The Statue of Unity is approximately 4 times taller than New York’s famous Statue of Liberty when plinths are discounted.2. The statue cost approximately $430m (29.9bn rupees) to build.3. The scale of the project is reflected in the staggering size and weight of its materials: the statue’s construction took 2,500,000 cubic feet of concrete, 5,700 tons of steel structure and 18,500 tons of reinforced steel rods.4. There are approximately 12,000 bronze panels covering the structure, weighing around 1,700 tons.5. It is projected that the memorial — remotely located 125 miles from the state capital, Ahmedabad — will become a nationalist pilgrimage for about 2.5 million visitors every year.6. The statue’s height surpasses the Spring Temple Buddha in Henan, China, which, at 420 feet was previously the tallest statue in the world.7. Visitors can go up to the viewing gallery, which is located near the chest of the statue at a height of 500 feet.8. The Gujarat government reportedly relocated some 185 families to make way the statue, compensating them with 1,200 acres (475 hectares) of new land.9. More than 2,000 Indian workers along with several hundred laborers from China contributed to the construction efforts.10. The project has divided opinion in India, with some criticizing the government’s public spending on the project and others protesting against the displacement of farmers to make way for the memorial.","10 Facts About India’s Statue of Unity, the World’s Tallest Statue ",Post-Construction
"31st October 2018 – This date is going to be remembered in the modern history as the day the “New India” announced its arrival on the world stage – the India that has the vision, strength of character and the technological capability to achieve something so unthinkable by the previous Indian standards. However, the Statue of Unity has had its share of critics as well. We have heard criticism ranging from “why waste so much money on a statue when so many people are poor and hungry in the country?” to “what about environment?” and “why not use to money to generate employment for the youth?”. This article aims to answer all those questions and provide a holistic view and a rationale behind creation of this statue. Question 1: – Why waste so much money on a statue when so many people are poor and hungry in the country?Based on the recent world bank report, India has shed its infamous title of highest number of people living in extreme poverty. More than 44 people in India come out of poverty every minute and as an economy it can also jump from 2nd largest to 3rd largest by the end of this year. There are a number of schemes run by the government for poverty alleviation which include Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana, Roshni: Skill Development Scheme for Tribals, and so on. All these schemes are doing a great job for moving people out of poverty. Apart from that, Antyodaya Anna Yojana ensures that poor people get food at subsidized rates so that they don’t have to go hungry to bed each night. Question 2: – Why not use the money for sick and the elderly then?Modi launched ‘world’s largest’ health insurance scheme. Ayushman Bharat program dubbed ‘Modicare’ promises to insure 500 million poor people across the country.1.5 lakh people have already benefited from Ayushman Bharat scheme within 1st month of launch. So, I think Modi got this covered too. Question 3: – Why not use the money to build infrastructure and roads in the country?Modi government got this covered as well-National Highway construction hits record 28 km a day in 2017Government to construct rural roads at 10 km per hour in next 14 months That’s right! 10 kms per hour equals approximately 1,00,000 km roads in the next 14 months!Let’s look at the whole exercise from a purely economic perspective. The cost of the statue is approximately Rs 2,989 crore, which houses valley of flowers, an observation deck, the Sardar Patel memorial, museum and audio-visual gallery, along with a 3-star hotel, a shopping center and a research center. The ticket to the statue is kept at Rs 350 and an average of 15,000 – 20,000 people are expected to visit the statue daily, considering Taj Mahal gets around 40k visitors each day. Going with the average, the total earnings just by selling the tickets comes out to be Rs 200-250 crore. This does not even include the earning through the 3-star hotel rooms and the shopping center. So, only by considering the ticket earning, the entire cost of the statue can be recovered in approximately 12-15 years. Moreover, the government has already said that it would like to conduct international and national conferences and summits in the statue premises, which would add to the total earnings. Not a bad deal for the tallest statue, I think. Furthermore, since this is bound to be a major tourist attraction for the world, the economic and tourist activity surrounding this project is bound to grow in the coming years. Tourism is the largest provider of employment in the world today, starting from hotels, restaurants to taxis and guides. This statue guarantees a lot of employment opportunities to the people in the surrounding areas in the coming years. This is significant especially because the area where the statue is located is predominantly a tribal area and tribal people are the one most in need of alternate employment. The employment generation and business potential of the Statue of Unity can be accurately predicted by calculating the economic activity generated by the Kankaria lake front in Ahmedabad or Taj Mahal in Agra.The metal and soil used for the construction of this statue has been taken from farmers who were asked to donate their old and unused farm equipment for this project. So, this serves as a great example of application of “best out of waste” philosophy that we hear every now and then.Creating the world’s tallest statue is, by no means, a small feat, considering the planning, design and execution, everything happened in India and was done by Indians. With this statue, Modi has basically shown to the world that we can build anything the world want us to build. We have the talent and the vigor to achieve it. If we can do it for us, we can do it for you too. Statue of Unity will serve as the largest endorsement of the talent that India possess.It is nobody’s case that Modi has done well on almost all fronts – economic, social, poverty alleviation and cleanliness. However, what Modi has demonstrated with the Statue of Liberty is more fundamental, that Indians can dream big and execute big whenever there is a political will. In fact, thinking big has been the hallmark of the Modi government, whether it was creating bank accounts for the poor, swachh bharat or rolling out the world’s largest health insurance scheme and nobody can fault him for breaking the age-old mould of thinking small.",The Statue of Unity – The criticism and the benefits,Post-Construction
"KEVADIA: Nearly two years after PM Narendra Modi unveiled the tallest statue in the world — Statue of Unity dedicated to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on the banks of the Narmada at Kevadia in Gujarat — it has not only turned out to be one of the most visited tourist destinations but has become a model of the “self-reliant” campaign, reports Akhilesh Singh.Most projects in its vicinity, be it hospitality or other services, have been developed on a “self sustenance” model, providing jobs to local residents, mostly tribals from the region. Before Covid-19 outbreak, there have been days when Kevadia witnessed the highest tourist footfall in the country, more than 35,000 a day.In one-and-half years, earnings from visits at the statue were over Rs 150 crore. Over 43 lakh tourists came to Kevadia from October 2018 to March this year, officials said.

"Leaders across the political spectrum on Wednesday paid tribute to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on his 143rd birth anniversary for his “strong leadership” and “steely will”, but criticised the Narendra Modi government’s decision to unveil a 182-metre-high statue of Patel in Gujarat’s Narmada district.Congress President Rahul Gandhi said it was ironic that Patel’s statue had been inaugurated “but every institution he helped build is being smashed”. “The systematic destruction of India’s institutions is nothing short of treason,” Gandhi added. His comments came in the wake of an ongoing tussle between the Centre and the Reserve Bank of India and the crisis in the Central Bureau of Investigation.AdvertisementGandhi said Patel was a Congressman who had no tolerance for “bigotry or communalism”.The Statue of Unity had been built at a cost of about Rs 3,000 crore and is the tallest in the world, surpassing China’s Spring Temple Buddha (128 metres).Senior Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge questioned why other leaders who fought for the country were not remembered. “Why did your party, your RSS organisation not remember them for nearly 70 years? This is all stunt,” ANI quoted him as saying.Kharge accused Modi of playing politics, “creating confusion and diverting from issues as he is facing several problems.” “Let’s see how people react in 2019, I hope they take a sensible decision,” the Congress leader said.Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati demanded an apology from the BJP for criticising her for installing statues of Dalit leaders during her term as Uttar Pradesh chief minister, PTI reported.Advertisement“All those in the BJP, the RSS and company need to apologise, especially to the people of the Bahujan Samaj, for terming the statues installed by the then BSP government to honour icons like Baba Saheb Ambedkar and others as wasteful expenditure,” she said in a statement.The BSP chief questioned why the BJP had not built Patel’s statue in Gujarat earlier despite being in power in the state for a long time. “The people of the country are also wondering if all this is not politics...”She also questioned the English nomenclature of the statue. Mayawati added that the “foreign stamp on the construction of Patel’s statue” will trouble the leader’s followers and accused the BJP and its government at the Centre of confining Patel to a region, calling it an example of the BJP’s narrow-mindedness.Communist Party of India General Secretary Suravaram Sudhakar Reddy demanded to know why a bigger statue of Mahatma Gandhi, who was born in Gujarat like Patel, had not been built. “They [BJP] do not like his [Gandhi’s] secularism, that is why they have not taken up [build his statue],” PTI quoted Reddy as saying. “Instead, they have gone for Patel, who had rightist ideas.”AdvertisementThe BJP was trying to appropriate Patel’s legacy and “snatch Patel from Congress party” since they do not have a national leader of big stature, Reddy added.Congress leader Shashi Tharoor also questioned why the BJP had not built a bigger statue of Gandhi, reported PTI. “The biggest one is in Parliament..But this is a 182 metre statue for his disciple,” Tharoor said. “Why is there such a big statue for a disciple of Gandhiji in the country where there is no statue of that size for the Mahatma?”He said the BJP was trying to hijack the legacy of freedom fighters and national heroes such as Patel as it has no leaders whose legacy it can celebrate.Adivasi activists releasedMeanwhile, police have released several Adivasi activists who were detained in Narmada and Surat districts ahead of the statue’s inauguration. A group of activists who were released from the Rajpipla police station around 3 pm raised slogans outside the police station. They had been detained for more than 15 hours.Farmers and adivasi activists had threatened to protest on Wednesday, demanding compensation for land used to build the statue.",‘Unveiling of Sardar Patel statue a stunt’: Opposition parties criticise Narendra Modi and BJP,Pre-Construction
"In the run-up to Lok Sabha elections of 2019, an article titled “Even if Statue of Unity becomes as famous as Taj Mahal, we may need 120 years to break even” was published in the Shekhar Gupta’s The Print. This article was written by Dhruv Rathee, seen by some as pro-Congress and some as pro-AAP blogger and YouTuber.In the article, the writer took a very critical view of the Statue of Unity project. He had said, “The Sardar Patel statue is about political symbolism, and does not add to India’s rich culture and history.”To prove his point that construction of Statue of Unity at the cost of $430 million (Rs 3,000 crore) is nonsensical, he gives the following argument.“Economically, this statue makes no sense either. The Taj Mahal is the most visited tourist attraction in India, which earns an annual revenue of Rs 25 crore from 8 million tourists. It would be optimistic to hope that the Sardar Patel Statue of Unity will get even a tenth of that number. But even if we assume that the Statue of Unity becomes as popular as the Taj Mahal, it would take more than 120 years to just break even. Add to that the maintenance cost, and it probably will never even become profitable.”The statue was opened to tourists in November 2018. According to a recent report, about 20.68 lakh tourists have already visited the statue in the last 10 months since it was first opened. This has generated a revenue of Rs 53.49 crore.The article in The Print had said it would be optimistic to hope that Sardar Patel’s statue will get even a tenth of the number of tourists who visit Taj Mahal (or 8 lakh a year). Actual figures now show that more than 20.68 lakh tourists have already visited the world’s tallest statue in less than a year’s time. It is about 2.5 times than what the writer of that article had claimed. So, the reality busts the fake narrative about the project.Apart from the number of tourists, the area around the Statue of Unity is seeing fast-paced development. According to the Financial Express report, “The administration of Narmada district is planning to introduce homestay facility for tourists visiting the world’s tallest statue, located in Kevadia Colony.” This homestay project will help in empowering the rural tribal women of the area to earn a living.",When Reality Factchecked Dhruv Rathee’s False Narrative on Statue of Unity,Post-Construction

"Statue of Unity, India’s ode to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and the Indian freedom struggle, will be the world’s tallest statue, twice the size of the Statue of Liberty. The Statue of Unity will be unveiled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 31, which also marks the 143rd birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, the Ironman of India. The world’s “tallest statue” dedicated to independent India’s first Home Minister stands at 182 metre (597 feet) tall.The monument is touted to become one of the most important tourist places of India. However, the gigantic project required years-long dedication and confronted an array of issues and challenges. Here are some challenges that authorities faced throughout the construction.Statue of Unity ConstructionThe cost of the project is worth Rs 2,989 crore and work is going on at five major sites, according to the Indian Express report. The statue, the walkway, the ticket counter, the food court, the four-lane approach highway and the yard where the parts are being assembled, and the Shrestha Bharat Bhavan (a 52-room three-star lodging facility) are being built. A massive 4,076 labourers are tirelessly working day and night. The labourers are divided into two shifts. Around 1000 workers are busy in cladding of the statue alone.Apart from local workers, a strong contingent of 200 from China have been working in batches for two-three months each since September 2017. L&T, which is the executing firm, says, “The construction has been done in four stages, including a mock-up, 3D scanning technique as well as a computer numerical control production technique for accurate reproduction of minute details.”Why Chinese involvementIn the last few days, a political slugfest erupted over the Chinese involvement in the making of the ‘Statue of Unity’. Congress President Rahul Gandhi, during a rally in Madhya Pradesh’s Satna, said, “The Prime Minister used to say that we will install the statue of Sardar Patel in Gujarat. It is unfortunate that the iron man’s statue will be inscribed with ‘Made-in-China’ as it is being made by China.” The statement drew sharp criticism from BJP and PM Modi who said, “People see caste, state, election… Stop belittling great personalities. Modi is living, abuse him 24 hours, and if that is not enough, do it for 26 hours.”However, the IE report says it was L&T which had recommended Chinese foundry Jiangxi Tongqing Metal Handicrafts Co. Ltd (or the TQ Art foundry) for moulding the cladding of the bronze statue. An official said that no foundry in India has the expertise to cast a bronze statue as tall as the Statue of Unity. Also, the aforementioned Chinese foundry is known for its bronze casts and the firm offered to work at a speed which will ensure that project will finish by the October 31 deadline.Cladding challengesThe cladding of the statue has remained a challenge. An L&T engineer told The Indian Express that the statue will have about 1,850 metric tonnes or 18.5 lakh kilogrammes of bronze cladding in all. The amount of steel and concrete used would amount to several times more. On December 15, 2013, then Gujarat CM Modi had flagged off 1,000 trucks to travel to seven lakh villages, carrying about three lakh empty kit boxes, to collect soil and the scrap-iron farm implements.Subsequently, by 2016, 135 metric tonnes of iron were collected in various forms. This cladding was done under the close watch of the award-winning designer Ram V Sutar. 5,000-odd bronze panels were transported over the sea and then by road. These were assembled at an off-site workshop in Kevadia Colony.Another challenge was showing the specifications, including showing Patel’s legs clad in a dhoti and his feet in sandals. These would mean the statue is thinner at the base than the top which goes against the norms of what other tall statues have followed. Officials have kept the slenderness ratio between the top and bottom half of the Patel statue to 16:19 — significantly higher than the 8:14 ratio norm in tall buildings.Wind, earthquake challengesNatural factors like wind, earthquake have posed a stiff challenge before engineers. A top Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd (SSNNL) official predicts the statue can sustain wind velocity of 220 km/hour and earthquakes measuring up to 6.5 on the Richter Scale, which are at a depth of 10 km and within a radius of 12 km of the statue. To resist earthquake and wind forces, engineering teams first constructed the core wall, the RCC spine of the statue. Then steel frames were affixed.Face challengeAnother challenge came in the form of the looks of the statue. Since Patel’s face will be an important aspect, special care has been given on the last few metres, comprising the head and shoulders. “We have set aside two weeks in the beginning of October to complete the face,” an L&T official was quoted as saying by IE.",Statue of Unity: Narendra Modi’s dream project faced tough challenges; here’s how they were seen off,Pre-Construction
"Before getting down to writing this piece and because the highly engaging and meticulously planned Bangalore Literature Festival took me away from my work desk for most of the last few days, I decided to Google the latest news and articles related to the inauguration of the colossal statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.Headline writers are often the finest interpreters of intent and the two editors who wrote the headings, unknowingly and unwittingly, collaborated to make a distressing political point: in its overzealousness to secure monopoly rights on the Sardar’s political legacy, this regime has willy-nilly made celebration of his memory bigger than the Republic of India, the very state which he is being credited with having single-handedly unified.It makes little difference to the government that unveiling of the ‘Statue of Unity’ – accompanied by similar rituals, in greater measure, that are witnessed every January 26 – fly pasts by the Indian Air Force, playing of patriotic music by ceremonial bands of the Army, Navy, IAF, and folk dance performances from Indian states, may undermine sanctity of the Republic Day celebrations. The effort is obvious: make this event grander than the annual feature. One of the two most important national and annual observances has been undermined because someone will preside over the ceremony with the objective of securing permanence in national iconography.Make no mistake, the occasion may be the inauguration on the Sardar’s birth anniversary but the purpose is to enable Prime Minister Narendra Modi to promote the claim of being the sole custodian of national unity and security.It must also not be forgotten that the decision to construct the Statue of Unity was made by Modi as Gujarat chief minister and the foundation stone was laid on October 31, 2013 – by when he had already been anointed Bharatiya Janata Party’s prime ministerial candidate.The Statue of Unity is commonly seen as the BJP’s attempt to insert itself into the freedom movement and its legacy by appropriating Patel as a counterpoint to Nehru. Credit: PTIOnly the naive would argue that there was no political motive behind the decision. The plan to forge the gigantic sculpture from melted-down metal and farming equipment collected from farmers who were asked to donate a symbolic tool was indication of using this project as a political vehicle. These scraps or iron were taken across India in processions even as Indians witnessed the electoral campaign.The programme was a throwback to the most divisive Ram Shila processions taken out by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad in 1989 as part of the Ayodhya agitation and times with the watershed Lok Sabha polls that year when the BJP dramatically improved its tally from two to 85. Undeniably, the entire project has been timed to promote Modi’s political fortunes.The project was in fact, first announced on October 7, 2010, to mark the beginning of the tenth year of Modi’s appointment as chief minister of Gujarat. Till June 2013, there was little development despite formation of a special purpose vehicle, the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust (SVPRET), because Modi’s prime ministerial ambitions were being blocked within the party.But two days after Modi was named as chairman of the 2014 Lok Sabha election campaign committee of the BJP at the national executive committee meeting in Goa in June 2013, he announced a nationwide campaign to collect small pieces of iron from farmers for using it to build the proposed statue.Its inaugural has now been timed with the impending assembly elections and the 2019 polls. The aim is clear – to enable Modi to position himself as the only Indian with the capacity to execute a project eulogising the Sardar. This puts the opposition in a quandary because any criticism of Modi’s showmanship will enable him to depict critics as being legatees of those who denied Patel his rightful place in the nation and history. In the process, not only will the Statue of Unity literally dwarf statues of all other Indians leaders of the, but the event will also enable the memory of the Sardar to rise imposingly over Mahatma Gandhi and more importantly Jawaharlal Nehru.The unveiling of the Statue of Unity comes close on the heels of the event in Red Fort when Modi launched celebrations to mark the 75th anniversary of the Azad Hind government, formed by ‘Netaji’ Subhas Chandra Bose. This event, full of high bluster, was spent more in running down the Congress and previous governments than on recalling the significance of Netaji’s action and explaining reasons leading to his joining hand with the Axis powers to secure independence.The event on October 21 was part of the politics of appropriation which the BJP and its affiliates have actively pursued in the past four and half years especially. Weeks prior to Modi’s show at Red Fort in the capital, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat addressed a carefully handpicked elite gathering in another sarkari venue in the Indian capital – Vigyan Bhawan. Over his three-day interaction, Bhagwat deviated from previous sangh criticism of the freedom struggle and appreciated Congress role in securing independence.Whether it is Modi unveiling Sardar Patel’s statues, launching anniversary celebrations of Azad Hindi Government or Quit India Movement (its 75th anniversary was marked by a special parliament session in August 2017), the public embrace of the legacies of political personalities like Dr B.R. Ambedkar, Jayaprakash Narayan, P.V. Narasimha Rao and of course Mahatma Gandhi, it is evidence that the Sangh parivar requires to appropriate the histories of other political forces in the country because its own history is not particularly laudatory.Much has been written about the number of times that the RSS or its other affiliates clashed with the ideas and ideals of those personalities they are now seeking to appropriate. Patel for instance, whose stellar role in bringing an end to Mahatma Gandhi’s last fast was written as part of an article on this website has been consistently misused to construct an alternate history which revolves around his conflict with Nehru on various issues. Yet, the Sangh leaders or their rare ideologues do not acknowledge that the relationship between Nehru and Patel was based not just on disagreement but also on how these were sorted out.Moreover, the Sardar was not a leader who camouflaged his Hindu nationalistic outlook. On the contrary, his affirmations in the constituent assembly, recognising the necessity of secularism for a democracy to be true to its spirit, provide evidence of the multi-layered personality that the Sardar was. A true soldier of Gandhi, he “stepped aside three times to enable Jawaharlal Nehru to become Congress president— in 1929, 1937 and 1946″ and never challenged Nehru’s leadership because of his faith in Gandhi’s judgement and conviction that it was the duty of “all Bapu’s soldiers to carry out his bequest”.Despite being aware that the appropriation of nationalist icons by the Sangh parivar is historically flimsy, they still must necessarily pursue this path because neither do Sangh icons resonate nationally, nor were they part of the freedom struggle.The three major episodes of the national movement – the Khilafat and Non-Cooperation movement, Civil Disobedience in the wake of Dandi March and the Quit India Movement, were conspicuous by complete absence of Hindu nationalists of all hues save those who were part of the Congress-led struggle. Although Nathuram Godse ceased to be a member of the RSS when he assassinated Gandhi, he was incubated in the RSS and retained links with the much idolised V.D.

"Before getting down to writing this piece and because the highly engaging and meticulously planned Bangalore Literature Festival took me away from my work desk for most of the last few days, I decided to Google the latest news and articles related to the inauguration of the colossal statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.Headline writers are often the finest interpreters of intent and the two editors who wrote the headings, unknowingly and unwittingly, collaborated to make a distressing political point: in its overzealousness to secure monopoly rights on the Sardar’s political legacy, this regime has willy-nilly made celebration of his memory bigger than the Republic of India, the very state which he is being credited with having single-handedly unified.It makes little difference to the government that unveiling of the ‘Statue of Unity’ – accompanied by similar rituals, in greater measure, that are witnessed every January 26 – fly pasts by the Indian Air Force, playing of patriotic music by ceremonial bands of the Army, Navy, IAF, and folk dance performances from Indian states, may undermine sanctity of the Republic Day celebrations. The effort is obvious: make this event grander than the annual feature. One of the two most important national and annual observances has been undermined because someone will preside over the ceremony with the objective of securing permanence in national iconography.Make no mistake, the occasion may be the inauguration on the Sardar’s birth anniversary but the purpose is to enable Prime Minister Narendra Modi to promote the claim of being the sole custodian of national unity and security.It must also not be forgotten that the decision to construct the Statue of Unity was made by Modi as Gujarat chief minister and the foundation stone was laid on October 31, 2013 – by when he had already been anointed Bharatiya Janata Party’s prime ministerial candidate.The Statue of Unity is commonly seen as the BJP’s attempt to insert itself into the freedom movement and its legacy by appropriating Patel as a counterpoint to Nehru. Credit: PTIOnly the naive would argue that there was no political motive behind the decision. The plan to forge the gigantic sculpture from melted-down metal and farming equipment collected from farmers who were asked to donate a symbolic tool was indication of using this project as a political vehicle. These scraps or iron were taken across India in processions even as Indians witnessed the electoral campaign.The programme was a throwback to the most divisive Ram Shila processions taken out by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad in 1989 as part of the Ayodhya agitation and times with the watershed Lok Sabha polls that year when the BJP dramatically improved its tally from two to 85. Undeniably, the entire project has been timed to promote Modi’s political fortunes.The project was in fact, first announced on October 7, 2010, to mark the beginning of the tenth year of Modi’s appointment as chief minister of Gujarat. Till June 2013, there was little development despite formation of a special purpose vehicle, the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust (SVPRET), because Modi’s prime ministerial ambitions were being blocked within the party.But two days after Modi was named as chairman of the 2014 Lok Sabha election campaign committee of the BJP at the national executive committee meeting in Goa in June 2013, he announced a nationwide campaign to collect small pieces of iron from farmers for using it to build the proposed statue.Its inaugural has now been timed with the impending assembly elections and the 2019 polls. The aim is clear – to enable Modi to position himself as the only Indian with the capacity to execute a project eulogising the Sardar. This puts the opposition in a quandary because any criticism of Modi’s showmanship will enable him to depict critics as being legatees of those who denied Patel his rightful place in the nation and history. In the process, not only will the Statue of Unity literally dwarf statues of all other Indians leaders of the, but the event will also enable the memory of the Sardar to rise imposingly over Mahatma Gandhi and more importantly Jawaharlal Nehru.The unveiling of the Statue of Unity comes close on the heels of the event in Red Fort when Modi launched celebrations to mark the 75th anniversary of the Azad Hind government, formed by ‘Netaji’ Subhas Chandra Bose.

"The unveiling of India’s 182-metre statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in Gujarat Wednesday, which is set to become the “world’s tallest”, is being widely reported by the international media. From describing it as “a showcase of India’s growing prosperity” to calling it an example of “BJP’s efforts to appropriate a popular national figure”, the statue has received both praise and criticism. The State of Unity will be unveiled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to mark Sardar Patel’s birth anniversary. The inauguration is expected to be a grand event planned along the lines of Republic Day celebrations in New Delhi.The foundation stone of the Rs 2,989 crore project, erected on the banks of the Narmada in Gujarat, was laid in October 2013 by Modi, who was the chief minister of Gujarat at the time. It has drawn flak from tribals and farmers living in the region who were against the enormous cost of the project as well as land acquisition by the government. They will observe a “black day” Wednesday,US mediaA report in the Washington Post states that the Statue of Unity “will give India bragging rights to the world’s tallest statue — a nearly 600-foot creation that says as much about India’s global aspirations as it does about the political ego of its leader”. It adds, “The $408 million gold-coloured colossus also spills over into present-day politics. It is considered a trifecta for Prime Minister Narendra Modi: a nod to his Hindu political base, a landmark site in his home state, and a showcase of the nation’s growing prosperity and status as a rising global power.”Describing it as an unofficial launch of the BJP’s 2019 election campaign, it adds that “Modi seems to relish the big-splash attention of the projects.”This report was carried by several organisations, including Canada’s National Post and Pakistan’s Dawn.Pakistan mediaPakistan’s Express Tribune states that the statue has “became an example of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) efforts to appropriate a popular national figure, as Patel was a member of the Congress Party, which now sits in opposition to BJP in India’s parliament.” Geo News, meanwhile, calling it “a burst of nationalist fervour”, highlights that “there is also a political motive to the mega project, with India heading into a campaign for a national election early next year.”Chinese mediaThe South China Post, which carries an AFP report, states that the “world’s biggest statue could quickly be outdone by a monument to a Hindu warrior king in the sea off Mumbai” referring to Chhatrapati Shivaji’s statue in Mumbai. The report adds that it overlooks the isolated Sardar Sarovar Dam, which was PM Modi’s pet project.British mediaBBC has highlighted how local farmers are “aghast” that the government has spent so much money on the statue. It quotes a local farmer saying, “Instead of spending money on a giant statue, the government should have used it for farmers in the district.” It refers to a 2016 government report which says the Narmada district is home to several residents who live in hunger, while primary school enrolment is falling and malnourishment persists.",Statue of Unity to be unveiled today: What the foreign press says on ‘world’s tallest statue’,Pre-Construction
"Sardar Patel’s statue at Ahmedabad was recently advertised for sale at Rs 30,000 crore by “unknown persons.”Clearly it was someone’s idea of a joke and could have been dismissed as such. But the quality of humour is strained; it droppeth as the gentle rain for only the cultured.It blesseth him that provides comedy and him that enjoys it. But it curses those bereft of a sense of humour, politicians for example.No wonder the politicians of Gujarat filed an FIR against the unknown persons on charges of cheating and forgery under the Penal Code, the Epidemic Diseases Act, and the Information Technology Act.Epidemic diseases? Administrators see the world in ways ordinary citizens cannot. The Sardar statue episode proves this yet again.This is a monument that openly copied the Statue of Liberty in New York, as is clear from the very name, State of Unity. But the unity theme was a contrived one unlike the liberty theme which was a natural one. That naturalness echoed in its immortal lines: “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free... I lift my lamp beside the golden door.”India had no such message to convey and no golden door to open.The Patel statue with its grandiose name was merely another attempt to show that those who put it up had a grand vision.But all that they could do was to make it the world’s tallest. For that the tribals were deprived of their land and 300 crocodiles were evicted to make way for tourist infrastructure.Even then, it did not become historically significant.The offer to sell the Sardar statue may not have culminated in a deal, but it shed light on the way life has changed for all of us.Overnight as it were, humour has become suspect if not undesirable. Ideas and assumptions have undergone wholesale changes.Neighbours, friends and relatives are no longer what they were before. What we have known is gone. What we do not know has taken over. Where we go and how are unknown to us.The transformation the word is undergoing is unprecedented. There were several Great Plagues in the past. One in the Istanbul area in the 6th century saw deaths at the rate of 10,000 a day.But at the end of each devastation, the world returned to what it was before. This time it will be a new world to which survivors return. In the past, we shaped our world. Now the world will shape us in ways to which we will have to adjust whether we like it or not.A look at just one factor is enough to bring out the catastrophic nature of the new changes overtaking us. Restrictions on movement and on gatherings of people mean that most workplaces have to close. Consequently, people are losing jobs en masse.Early estimates said 400 million Indians will be devoured by unemployment and pushed into poverty. Even the IT sector in Bengaluru has companies announcing 30 per cent salary cuts and terminations that run into hundreds. Unemployment on this scale will shake the foundations of any nation-state.The days beyond maybe worse, not better. Reports are out recalling a conference of scientists in Germany last year. Apparently they had sounded a warning.The frozen earth of Arctic, they had said, was home to microbes that had remained dormant for centuries because of the ice. Now the Arctic is warming up, rapidly at that, and the microbes are getting released.One virus, described as a giant, was found to have remained frozen in an ice core for 30,000 years. The giant is now free.Maybe now we will pay attention to authors who wrote novels on microbes. I wish I had read some of them.But till yesterday, microbes were a boring subject and I could not have been the only one who considered reading fiction about them a waste of time.Now they say “Vitals” by Greg Bear (2002) is very much about the bacteria phenomenon that we have run into. Look up Google and you will see that the “Bacteria Book List” is pretty long. I found the term “bioterrorism” there. And a book with the title “Apocalypse by Epidemic.”We think that we, mankind, are the ultimate power wielders. We can declare lockdowns as we please, criticise prime ministers, promote communalism, even team up with VIPs to break the law. But before the bacteria, we are not just powerless; we are meaningless.",The truth is: We are meaningless,Post-Construction
"Thiruvananthapuram: As Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the world's tallest statue to celebrate Vallabhbhai Patel, Opposition parties on Wednesday questioned the BJP as to why there was no bigger statue for Mahatma Gandhi and also accused the ruling party of trying to ""hijack"" the legacy of Independence heroes like Sardar Patel.Congress chief Rahul Gandhi took a swipe at Modi, saying it is ""ironic"" that a statue of Sardar Patel is being inaugurated, but every institution he helped build is being destroyed while BSP chief Mayawati demanded an apology from the BJP and the RSS who flayed her over the statues of Dalit leaders her government had installed in Uttar Pradesh.Image of the Statue of Unity. Twitter/@DG_DoordarshanGandhi also alleged that the ""systematic destruction"" of India's institutions is nothing short of ""treason"".After unveiling the 182-metre structure in his home state of Gujarat on Patel's 143rd birth anniversary, Modi addressed the criticism of the decision to build the monument, questioning whether any crime had been committed by constructing such memorials for national heroes like Patel.""We are criticized for praising the contributions of national heroes like Sardar Patel. We are made to feel as if we have committed a serious crime,"" he said.He then posed a question to the audience, ""You tell me, is it a crime to remember our national heroes?"". To this, the audience replied in the negative.Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said there was no such gigantic statue of Mahatma Gandhi in the country and wanted to know why BJP had not built a bigger statue for him.""The biggest one is in Parliament, but this is a 182-metre statue for his disciple. Why is there such a big statue for a disciple of Gandhiji in the country where there is no statue of that size for the Mahatma?"" he asked while addressing a function at the district congress committee office in Thiruvananthapuram.""Patel, a very simple person, was known as the disciple of Gandhiji,"" Tharoor said.""I am asking a question...Is it right to erect such an imposing statue of Patel, a man of simplicity and a true Gandhian, who moved along with poor peasants,"" he said.Tharoor said BJP had no answer to the query why they did not erect a bigger statue of the Mahatma.""The reason is that they do not believe in Mahatma Gandhi's principles of non-violence,"" he alleged.He also alleged that BJP was trying to ""hijack"" the legacy of freedom fighters and national heroes like Patel as they have no leaders of their own in history to celebrate.He said Patel was a Congress leader and BJP should not be allowed to adopt him.Gandhi said Patel was a patriot, who fought for a independent, united and secular India. ""A man with a steely will, tempered by compassion, he was a Congressman to the core, who had no tolerance for bigotry or communalism,"" he tweeted.Mayawati accused the BJP and its government at the Centre of confining Patel to a region, saying this is an example of BJP's ""narrow-mindedness"".""All those in the BJP, the RSS and company need to apologise, especially to the people of the Bahujan Samaj Party, for terming the statues installed by the then BSP government to honour icons like Baba Saheb Ambedkar and others as wasteful expenditure,"" she said in a statement released in Lucknow.""The people of the country are also wondering if all this is not politics, and if the BJP really had this love for Patel why had they not put up such a massive statue earlier in Gujarat where they are in power for a long time,"" the chief of BSP said.Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge slammed BJP for using the statue of Sardar Patel for their ""vested interests"".BJP remembering Patel was an ""election gimmick"", Kharge told reporters at Hubballi in Karnataka.The Congress leader said, ""Every year BJP remembers a different freedom fighter - sometimes they remember Patel, sometimes Gandhi for Swachch Bharat Abhiyan and sometimes they remember Dr BR Ambedkar and Subhas Chandra Bose. These are all their election stunts. They never had respect for those who fought for the freedom of India. Jawaharlal Nehru was the prime minister while Patel was home minister. Naturally credit goes to the prime minister. It is not good to project somebody to undermine somebody else,"" Kharge said.CPI general secretary Suravaram Sudhakar Reddy echoed similar sentiments.Reddy demanded to know why a bigger statue of Mahatma Gandhi was not built by the BJP. He said while there was no objection over the monument built for Patel, what was surprising was why a bigger statue for the father of the nation, who was also born in Gujarat, was not thought of.""They (BJP) do not like his (Gandhi's) secularism, that is why they have not build his statue. Instead, they have gone for Patel, who had rightist ideas,"" the CPI general secretary alleged.Reddy also charged the BJP with trying to ""appropriate"" the legacy of Patel.""We have no objection to Sardar Patel's statue. With all due respect to him (Patel), we feel Mahatma Gandhi is the tallest leader of Indian politics. He is the father of the nation,"" he told PTI in Hyderabad.""Mahatma Gandhi's statue should have been bigger, he is leader of the highest stature than anybody else,"" he said.","After Narendra Modi unveils Statue of Unity, Opposition asks BJP why there isn't bigger structure for Gandhi ",Pre-Construction
"Gujarat, India, now boasts the tallest statue in the world.The nearly 600-foot-tall Statue of Unity, completed on November 1, is a bronze duplicate of India’s first deputy prime minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. It was designed and master planned by Michael Graves Architecture & Design (MGA) and is intended to anchor what will eventually become a resort.The monument took eight years to design and four to build. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, at the time still the chief minister of Gujarat, first proposed the sculpture in 2010 and construction began in 2014. The statue proper, designed by Indian sculptor Ram V. Sutar, reaches nearly 50-stories tall and sits on a three-tiered base that boosts the height to its record-breaking status.The geometrically-sculpted base sits on its own riverine island and is connected to the mainland via a pedestrian and road bridge. Inside, guests are met with a visitor’s center, hotel, and an exhibition hall, all of which is topped with a memorial garden. Part of the challenge that MGA faced in designing an occupiable structure—a 500-foot-tall viewing platform in the chest is accessible through elevators that run through the statue—is the sculpture’s “walking pose.” The non-symmetrical pose posed a challenge in orienting the base, and MGA managed to hide the zig-zagging elevator system inside of the memorial’s flowing robes.Two structural concrete cores were used to anchor the Statue of Unity, which support the steel framework (cast from scrap sourced all over India) attached to the 2,000 tons of exterior bronze paneling.Vallabhai Patel was a central figure in the Indian independence struggle as well as the unification of India’s 567 British vassal states into one country. A rammed earth wall, constructed from dirt taken from every state in India, is used at the State of Unity’s base as a background for the national flag.The $460 million statue won’t be the world’s tallest for long, as similar megaprojects are already in the pipeline. The Spring Temple Buddha in China, knocked down to second place, is planning to add its own podium and boost its height from 500 feet to 682 feet tall, and a 695-foot-tall statue of the Indian warrior-king Chhatrapati Shivaji is slated to open off of the coast of Mumbai in 2020.",Michael Graves Architecture completes the world's tallest statue,Post-Construction
"The social media went berserk on Saturday after tourists uploaded videos showing rainwater pouring inside an observation gallery within the Statue of Unity in Gujarat.“We had come with great hope to see the world’s tallest statue. But we are feeling bad looking at the statue in the rain. It has not rained heavily, and already the main hall and viewing gallery of the statue is filled with water. It is unfortunate,” a tourist was quoted.Videos of pools of water on the floor and water dripping off the roof of the Rs. 3,000-crore statue drew criticism from many, who termed the incident “unfortunate”.The 182-meter Statue of Unity, a memorial to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is the tallest structure of its kind in the world and was inaugurated with much fanfare in 2018.However, Narmada Collector IK Patel, who is also the chief administrator for the statue, said that it was “natural” for water to seep inside the viewing gallery.“The viewing gallery is open with grills on the chest of the statue. The rear side of the gallery is covered by glass. The front view is open as per design. So it is natural that water will enter when it rains,” he said.“There is a channel to dispose of rainwater. But when the wind speed is more, lots of water comes in and house-keeping personnel continuously drain it out. It is not leakage as is being claimed,” Patel added.A tweet from the Statue of Unity’s official Twitter handle said the incident was “being promptly tackled by the maintenance team”.However, the incident received sharp criticism from several quarters.“One rain and it gets flooded, water leaking from the roof and front. Designers couldn’t even think of a design to prevent the rain from flooding the statue. What a Shame,” wrote prominent YouTuber Dhruv Rathee in a Facebook post and a Tweet.A tweeter user who goes by the name TheAgeOfBananas and has the twitter handle as @iScrew even photoshopped the statue and put a raincoat over it.It may be mentioned here that the Statue of Unity’s viewing gallery is situated at a height of around 500 feet and visitors can see “a spectacular view” of the Sardar Sarovar Dam and its surrounding areas from here.",Rain Enters Statue Of Unity                                                                     ,Post-Construction
"The Statue of Unity is designed as a naturalistic and historically accurate representation of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, wearing characteristic garments, in a walking stance. The total height of the statue from its base will be 240-metre consisting base level of 58 metres and statue of 182 metres. The Statue of Unity is almost 29 metres taller than China’s Spring Temple Buddha, the world’s current tallest statue at 153 metres, and almost twice as high as the 93-metre Statue of Liberty in New York.  PM Narendra Modi, who was then Chief Minister of Gujrat, had laid the foundation stone for the project on 31 October 2013.The Gujarat government expects that an average of over 15,000 tourists will visit the monument daily. The project will generate approximately 15,000 direct jobs for the tribal people every year.It could have paid for 2 IITs, 5 IIMs & agricultural projectsStatue of Unity, Sardar PatelLocated on a river island called ‘Sadhu Bet’, the Statue of Unity is about 3.5 km away from the Narmada dam. A 250-metre long bridge provides connectivity to the island. It is designed to withstand winds, vibrations and earthquake. The monument is designed by Ram V. Sutar, who shot to fame with the 45-feet-high Chambal monument at Gandhi Sagar dam in Madhya Pradesh. Mr Sutar has studied from Sir J.J. School of Art, Mumbai in 1953.The observation deck, situated at a height of around 500 ft from the river bed, will accommodate up to 200 people at a time. It will provide visitors a panoramic view, enabling them to see the beautiful Satpura and Vindhyachal mountain ranges, the 212 km long Sardar Sarovar Reservoir, and the 12 km long Garudeshwar Reservoir. For the comfort of the visitors against high wind forces, a 400-ton Tuned Mass Damper system has been provided above the observation deck.It is constructed with steel framing, reinforced cement concrete and bronze cladding. The statue needed 75000 cubic metres of concrete, 5700 metric tonne steel structure, 18500 tonnes reinforced steel rods, 22500-tonne bronze sheets for construction.The three-level base of the Statue – exhibit floor, mezzanine and roof – will contain a Memorial Garden and a large continuous museum/exhibition hall, comprising exhibits that focus on the life and contributions of Vallabhbhai Patel.Fast elevators to reduce transit time for visitors. There will also be a moving walkway for the disabled and senior citizens.A viewing gallery at 153 metres can accommodate up to 200 visitors at a go and will offer an expansive view of the dam, the Satpura and Vindhya mountain ranges and other sites.There will also be a museum and a sound and light show depicting the life and times of Sardar Patel.A shopping centre.A selfie point has been designated a few meters from the statue.A 52-room three-star hotel and two tent cities with 250 tents are currently under construction to accommodate the visitors to the site.Building the Statue of UnityBuilt by Larsen & Toubro (L&T), as many as 3,400 workers and 250 engineers worked round the clock for 42 months.The Statue of Unity is built at a cost of Rs 2,989 crore.   The statue was built on a PPP model, with most of the money raised by the Government of Gujarat.The Government of Gujarat had allotted ₹100 crore for the project in the budget for 2012-13 and ₹500 crore in 2014-15.In the 2014-15 Union Budget, ₹2 billion (US$28 million) were allocated for the construction of the statue.A consortium of Turner Construction (project manage of Burj Khalifa), Michael Graves and Associates and Meinhardt Group, supervised the project. It took 56 months to complete the project; 15 months for planning, 40 months for construction and two months for handing over by the consortium.Indian infrastructure company Larsen & Toubro won the contract on 27 October 2014 for its lowest bid of ₹2,989 crore (US$420 million) for the design, construction and maintenance. They commenced the construction on 31 October 2014. In the first phase of ₹2,989 crore (US$420 million) project, ₹1347 crore is for the main statue, ₹235 crore for exhibition hall and convention centre, ₹83 crore for the bridge connecting the memorial to the mainland and ₹657 crore for the maintenance of the structure for 15 years after its completion.Accenture provides digital media outreach programme.Comparison of Statue of Unity with Other StatuesComparison of Statue of Unity of Sardar Patel with other statuesCriticism on Construction of the StatueThe construction of the statue faced criticism from several quarters,The statue is seen as an unsubtle attempt by Mr Modi and his party to undermine the Congress party and appropriate one of its independence-era icons. Sardar Patel was first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru’s deputy, his home minister and a lifelong Congressman.Local people have opposed land acquisition for tourism infrastructure development around the statue. They also claimed that Sadhu Bet was originally called Varata Bawa Tekri, named after a local deity, and so it was a site of religious importance.Environmental activists wrote a letter to the central government that this project started implementation without environmental clearance from the ministry.People of Kevadia, Kothi, Waghodia, Limbdi, Navagam and Gora villages opposed the construction of the statue demanding back land rights of formerly acquired 927 acres of land for the dam and the formation of Garudeshwar taluka. They also opposed the formation of Kevadia Area Development Authority (KADA) and the construction of Garudeshwar weir-cum-causeway project. The government of Gujarat accepted their demands.When ₹2 billion (US$28 million) was allocated for the statue in the 2014-15 Union budget, several people and the political parties criticised the expenditure for the statue over other priorities like women’s safety, education and agricultural schemes.Bronze panels were cast at a foundry in China. Hundreds of Chinese workers were also spotted at the construction site. L&T has contracted with TQ Art Foundry; subsidiary of the Jiangxi Toqine Company based in Nanchang, China; for the bronze cladding of the statue. It was criticised by Indian National Congress, the opposition party in Gujarat Legislative Assembly.Revenue that can be earned through tourismThe entry ticket for the Statue of Unity and viewing gallery is Rs 350 for adults and Rs 200 for children in the 3-15 age group.

He belonged to the Leuva Patel Patidar community of Central Gujarat. He was an Indian barrister and statesman, a senior leader of the Indian National Congress and a founding father of the Republic of India who played a leading role in the country’s struggle for independence and guided its integration into a united, independent nation. In India and elsewhere, he was often called Sardar, Chief in Hindi, Urdu, and Persian. He acted as de facto Supreme Commander-in-chief of Indian army during the political integration of India and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947In 2014, the Government of India introduced a commemoration of Patel, held annually on his birthday, 31 October, and known as Rashtriya Ekta Diwas (National Unity Day). BTW Patel’s date of birth was never officially recorded; Patel entered it as 31 October on his matriculation examination papers.Vallabhbhai Patel was born and raised in the countryside of Gujarat. He was a successful lawyer. He subsequently organised peasants from Kheda, Borsad, and Bardoli in Gujarat in non-violent civil disobedience against the British Raj, becoming one of the most influential leaders in Gujarat. He rose to the leadership of the Indian National Congress, organising the party for elections in 1934 and 1937 while promoting the Quit India Movement.As the first Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of India, Patel organised relief efforts for refugees fleeing from Punjab and Delhi and worked to restore peace.He led the task of forging a united India, successfully integrating into the newly independent nation those British colonial provinces that had been “allocated” to India. Besides those provinces that had been under direct British rule, approximately 565 self-governing princely states had been released from British suzerainty by the Indian Independence Act of 1947. Threatening military force, Patel persuaded almost every princely state to accede to India. His commitment to national integration in the newly independent country was total and uncompromising, earning him the sobriquet “Iron Man of India”. He is also remembered as the “patron saint of India’s civil servants” for having established the modern all-India services system. He is also called the “Unifier of India”.Why is Vallbhbhai Patel called Sardar?Women of Bardoli bestowed the title Sardar to Vallebhai Patel, which in Gujarati and most Indian languages means Chief or Leader.The Bardoli Satyagraha of 1928, in the state of Gujarat, India during the period of the British Raj, was a major episode of civil disobedience and revolt in the Indian Independence Movement. The movement was eventually led by Vallabhbhai Patel.In 1925, the taluka of Bardoli in Gujarat suffered from floods and famine, causing crop production to suffer and leaving farmers facing great financial troubles. However, the government of the Bombay Presidency had raised the tax rate by 30% that year, and despite petitions from civic groups, refused to cancel the rise in the face of the calamities. The situation for the farmers was grave enough that they barely had enough property and crops to pay off the tax, let alone for feeding themselves afterwards.When a delegation of farmers approached Patel, he told frankly that they should realize fully what a revolt would imply. He would not lead them unless he had the unanimous understanding and agreement of all the villages involved. Refusing payment of taxes could lead to their property being confiscated, including their lands, and many would go to jail. They could face complete decimation. The villagers replied that they were prepared for the worst, but definitely could not accept the government’s injustice.In 1928, an agreement was finally brokered by a Parsi member of the Bombay government. The Government agreed to restore the confiscated lands and properties, as well as cancel revenue payment not only for the year but cancel the 30% raise until after the succeeding year.The momentum from the Bardoli victory aided in the resurrection of the freedom struggle nationwide.  In 1930, the Congress would declare Indian independence, and the Salt Satyagraha would be launched by Gandhi.  It was after Bardoli Satyagraha that Sardar Patel became one of India’s most important leaders.",Statue of Unity and Sardar Vallabhbhai Pate,Post-Construction
"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday inaugurated the world’s tallest statue dedicated to India’s first home minister, Vallabhbhai Patel, on his 143rd birth anniversary at Kevadiya in Gujarat’s Narmada district. The 182-metre steel and bronze Statue of Unity is nearly twice the height of New York’s Statue of Liberty.Modi called the statue not only a tribute to Patel but also “an expression of a new India’s new self confidence”. He recalled the role Patel played in “uniting the country” after independence in 1947. “Had Sardar Saheb not vowed (to unite India), then to see lions of Gir, to worship at the Somnath Temple and to visit Charminar, we would have needed a visa,’’ Modi said.He was referring to landmarks in Gujarat’s Junagarh and Hyderabad, which were among the 562 nominally-independent princely states across India under the British Patel played a key role in integrating with the Indian union after independence.“If we are able to move freely from Kutch to Kohima and from Kargil to Kanyakumari, it is because of Sardar Saheb,” Modi said, adding he was surprised over the criticism he has faced over the statue that has cost ₹2,989 crore. “We are criticised for praising sons of the soil. We are made to feel as if we have committed a major crime.”MORE FROM THIS SECTIONModi said Patel wanted India to be “empowered, robust, sensitive, alert and inclusive”. Modi said his government was taking “all the steps to fulfill his dreams”. He listed the schemes and projects to highlight how they were in line with Patel’s vision. “We are working on the Bhagirath project to provide concrete houses to the homeless. We have provided electricity to 18,000 villages, which were deprived of power supply for all these years after Independence.”The work to provide road and digital connectivity to every village is on a fast track. “We are providing gas connection as well as toilets to every household”.He referred to his resolve for “Ek Bharat, Shrestha Bharat (One India, Superior India)” and called maintaining the country’s unity a “responsibility he [Patel] had passed on to us”. “It is our responsibility to answer, with full force, all the efforts made to divide the country”.Modi said the statue reflects India’s engineering and technical capabilities. “The structure is a reminder to those questioning India’s existence…. This nation was, is and will remain eternal.”He said he thought of building the statue when he was the Gujarat chief minister as he wanted the person, who contributed immensely to make the country one, to get the respect he deserved. Modi, who laid the statue’s foundation stone in 2013, added his sentiments were same like “crores of Indians”.Thirty-seven members of Patel’s family, some of whom had flown from the US, attended the event. “This is a once-in-a-lifetime moment. The statue will remain a source of inspiration for generations to come,” said Patel’s grandnephew, Dhirubhai Patel, who lives in Vadodara.Urmilaben, Patel’s grandniece, said Modi has kept the independence hero’s legacy alive by having the statue built.The statue’s inauguration is seen as part of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) efforts to honour the leaders it accuses the Congress, which has ruled the country for 49 years, of ignoring.In his response to the inauguration, Congress president, Rahul Gandhi, accused the government of destroying the institutions Patel helped build. “Ironic that a statue of Sardar Patel is being inaugurated, but every institution he helped build is being smashed,” he tweeted. Gandhi called Patel a patriot, who fought for an independent, united and secular India. “A man with a steely will, tempered by compassion, he was a Congressman to the core, who had no tolerance for bigotry or communalism”.Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati asked the BJP and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) to apologise for criticising her for building statues of Dalit leaders when she was in power in Uttar Pradesh. “All those in the BJP, the RSS and company need to apologise, especially to the people of the Bahujan Samaj, for terming the statues the then BSP government installed to honour icons like Baba Saheb Ambedkar and others as wasteful expenditure,” she said.","World’s tallest, Statue of Unity, gets a grand opening",Post-Construction
"Eight years after the proposal, Modi on Wednesday unveiled the Statue Of Unity. The world’s tallest statue at 182-meters built to pay tribute to India’s first Home Minister, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. While the Modi-led government was busy in taking pride and full credit for the statue, 73 tribal villages near the Kevadiya district, the closest district to the statue did not cook food in protest. Others protested by burning tyres and releasing black balloons. According to the Hindustan Times, the protesters claimed that many families who got displaced because of the development of the Sardar Sarovar Dam near which the statue did not receive a proper rehabilitation package by the government. They have also alleged that many trees have been cut surrounding Sardar’s statue for at least 3 km causing environmental damage in tribal areas. Tribal area in danger According to the NDTV, the local organisations claimed that almost 72,000 tribal families have been affected by the statue project. “A 3000-crore statue in one of the most backward districts of Gujarat is a farce. We are not against Sardar Patel, but we want schools and hospitals,” said Praful Vasava, a tribal leader who is among the many protestors who got arrested before they could take out the rally in protest of the inauguration. Advertisement Markets were shut in Bharuch, Songadh and Rajpipla districts to protest the Statue of Unity. Many protestors came on the streets with placards written in blood. The opposition parties supported the protest; 17 Congress MLAs and Independent MLA Jignesh Mewani backed it. An Activist, Raj Vasava who was also taken into custody said, “We do not cook while mourning a death in the family. Today is an equivalent day. Though we were provided food at Songadh police station, we did not eat as our community is fasting today.” Earlier on October 31, Monday, headmen of 22 villages situated near the Sardar Sarovar Dam, on the day of inauguration had written a letter to the PM Modi stating that they would not welcome the PM for the inauguration ceremony, as reported by the Outlook. The villagers claimed that their protest is because the construction of statue has destructed the environment. They also boycotted the event. “These forests, rivers, waterfalls, land and agriculture supported us for generations. We survived on them. But, everything is being destroyed now, and celebrations are also planned…” said the letter. No proper rehabilitation Earlier some 200 families from Kevadiya village were rehabilitated to the nearby Kaba village for the development of the areas surrounding the dam and the statue following which the tribals raised their concerns and started their protest. The villagers claim that they were offered compensation for their land. However, they did not want it as it was their ancestral land which they did not want to leave. The BJP calls the protest Congress-backed. It says that the statue will help in tourism and would also help in the development. The BJP also claimed that the villagers were happy and the protest was just ‘sponsored’. On the other hand, reacting to it, Congress denied all the accusations. According to The Indian Express, on the day of the Statue of Unity Inauguration Sardar Patel’s extended family was present at the event. When asked about their reaction on the unveiling of the tallest statue that costed more than 3,000 crores, the 91-year-old Sardar’s grandnephew said, that the tribute was long overdue but added that Patel himself would have said no for the statue as he understood the value of money. ","72,000 Tribals Protest Against Statue Of Unity; Burn Tyres, Release Black Balloons & Refuse To Cook Food",Post-Construction

"It is peculiar that when something good comes out of India, sections of British society start carping about India’s poverty. No other country is as obsessed with India’s poor as Britain (although it is a notable subculture in the media of other countries of the Anglosphere).In 2008, when an Indian spacecraft discovered water on the moon, the British media was aghast that India was wasting its resources on such high-tech gimmicks while it has millions (sorry, hundreds of millions) of poor people.A year later when India launched its first nuclear submarine, the British questioned India’s need for such expensive weapons when according to the Brits more than 800 million people survived on $2 a day.The lament is always the same: Why is Britain giving aid to a country that spends so much on its military and ‘vanity’ projects?Indians have heard that old record repeatedly and they are tired of it. But not the British – they are raking it up again in the backdrop of the inauguration of the Statue of Unity in Gujarat.In a tizzy over PatelBarely had the cheers erupted across India when the world’s tallest statue was unveiled that the British media went after it. According to the Daily Mail, (1) Britain donated more than £1billion to India in the years when New Delhi was “lavishing a fortune on building the world’s tallest statue”. The colossal bronze memorial – almost twice the height of the Statue of Liberty in New York – was “immediately condemned as an expensive vanity project”.The newspaper continues: “In the 56 months it took to construct the £330million Statue of Unity, UK taxpayers gave India £1.17billion in foreign aid, according to official figures….The engineering project started in 2012, when British taxpayers donated almost £300 million to India. In 2013 a further £268 million was given, in 2014 the figure was £278 million and in 2015 it was £185 million, followed by smaller amounts after that. As the cash rolled in from Britain, the Indian authorities poured billions of rupees into building the 597 feet tall bronze likeness of Sardar Patel, one of the heroes of India’s independence movement.”Big-ticket Indian defence and aerospace projects invariably draw petulant comments in Britain, partly because the British once enjoyed a leadership position in these fields whereas today it is forced to watch from the sidelines as India, China and South Korea reach for the stars. The Mail says the Indian government is planning to spend millions on a lunar probe called Chandrayaan-2 – despite “230 million Indians living in poverty”. (2)Tory MP Peter Bone added his two bits: “To take £1.1billion in aid from us and then at the same time spend £330million on a statue is a total nonsense and it is the sort of thing that drives people mad.”Big Ben and Victorian povertyThe British – and their liberal slaves in India – should know that India is not Somalia or the Philippines that cannot afford to build memorials to its great heroes. India is a leading economy and has enough money for development projects and buildings that inspire people. Sardar Vallabhai Patel was the most important Indian leader of the previous century; without him the British and Indian Muslims – with no small help from Gandhi and Nehru – would have balkanised India. More such statues of unifiers such as Shivaji, Rana Pratap, Rana Kumbha, Raja Raja Chola, Rajendra Chola and Harshavardhana should be built across the country.That brings us to monumental projects that other nations have undertaken. Take London’s Big Ben – one of the world’s most iconic clock towers. The 159-feet structure was planned in 1844 and completed in 1859. Was London a modern city back then? On the contrary, the living conditions of the vast majority of people in the metropolis were appalling.In his book The Victorian Underworld, Kellow Chesney gives a graphic description of the conditions in which many Londoners were living: “Hideous slums, some of them acres wide, some no more than crannies of obscure misery, make up a substantial part of the, metropolis … In big, once handsome houses, thirty or more people of all ages may inhabit a single room.” (3)Great wealth and extreme poverty lived side by side because the tenements, slums, rookeries were only a stone’s throw from the large elegant houses of the rich. In 1849, Henry Mayhew, an investigative journalist for the Morning Chronicle, described a London Street with a tidal ditch running through it, into which drains and sewers emptied. The ditch contained the only water the people in the street had to drink, and it was “the colour of strong green tea”, in fact it was “more like watery mud than muddy water”.This is the report Mayhew gave: “As we gazed in horror at it, we saw drains and sewers emptying their filthy contents into it; we saw a whole tier of doorless privies in the open road, common to men and women built over it; we heard bucket after bucket of filth splash into it.” (3)Many women took to prostitution because the alternatives were so grim. Entire streets in the slums of London were inhabited by prostitutes. Many girls viewed a few years ‘on the game’ as a sensible way to build up a little capital to invest in a small business later, but their future was often cut short by sexually transmitted diseases. (4)Children as well as adultsIn her book The Victorian Town Child, Pamela Horn writes: “In 1848 Lord Ashley referred to more than 30,000 naked, filthy, roaming lawless and deserted children in and around the metropolis.”You get the picture – the Victorian Era, which evokes much nostalgia among Britons, was a dystopian nightmare but it also gave London some of its most famous monuments. Compared with London of the 1850s, Gujarat is a prosperous state with a dynamic economy. So to say that India shouldn’t build monuments of vanity is just churlish. Basically, what the British should say honestly is: “We are envious that you Indians can build so big.”What’s bugging Britain?After it was kicked out of India in 1947, Britain kept up the pretence that it is fascinated by India. Their view was that the British Raj – if you ignored its brutal aspects – was the glue that bonded both nations. They argued that for Britain, India is like the high school crush – you never quite forget your first love.But in recent years that mask has slipped. As Indian companies started snapping up the crown jewels of British industry (Corus, Land Rover, Jaguar) the colonial aversion for Indians reappeared. It doesn’t matter that India is the second largest investor in the UK after Japan, generating tens of thousands of local jobs.India’s relentless rise back to prosperity comes at a time when Britain is in steep decline and poverty and hunger are common there. While India doles out more than $6 billion in aid (including a generous multi-million pound sterling grant to Cambridge University), London’s arc of influence is shrinking. While the Royal Navy is to be scuttled to a littoral force of 19 ships, India is building a 270-ship navy. Last week, when the Royal Navy’s new aircraft carrier sailed into New York, Russia’s RT (5) questioned “whether Britain even needed any new aircraft carriers, considering that paying for them meant the navy couldn’t then afford to pay for enough sailors to actually sail them”.Keep your peanutsSo how much is this aid that the British are getting so crabby about? Chew on this – a big fat £52 million ($67 million) that Indians should be grateful for. Just to keep things in perspective, British aid to India in 2018 is less than M.S. Dhoni’s net worth of $78 million. It’s the kind of cash Mukesh Ambani, the richest man in India, probably leaves as loose change in his office drawers.The irony is that India doesn’t want the money. In fact, seven years ago former Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee and other Indian ministers had tried to terminate Britain’s aid – but relented after the British begged them to keep taking the money. In fact, Mukherjee famously mocked the UK’s contribution, saying: “We do not require the aid. It is a peanut in our total developmental expenditure.” (6)Further, according to a leaked memo, senior Indian diplomat Nirupama Rao had proposed “not to avail of any further British assistance with effect from April 1, 2011” because of the “negative publicity of Indian poverty promoted by Britain’s DFID”. However, London requested Delhi to keep taking the money because cancelling the programme would cause “grave political embarrassment” to Britain.Let that sink in – Britain wants to give aid to India not because India needs it, but because the British wish to continue with the pretence that they are a great power that continues to civilise brown people. You know, the “white man’s burden”.Politics – and dangers – of aidThe British have good reasons to continue the DFID’s work in India. The nation of shopkeepers has little to offer India by way of trade, so aid acts as a useful toehold. According to Britain’s former Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell, the focus of British aid would be public-private partnerships rather than education or health. Translation: British aid is being diverted to schemes that sound uncannily like lobbying.Anyway, appearing to care for the poor in India also does wonders for Britain’s self-esteem. Images of British citizens working amidst thin, unkempt children hawking stuff on the streets reinforces the widespread belief in Britain that colonialism was okay because Indians are unfit to govern themselves.Another spinoff is that having British natives on the ground in India is handy when it comes to recruiting informers and spies. This isn’t as farfetched as it sounds. Employment in a nondescript NGO would be the perfect cover for British intelligence agents. Only someone incredibly naive would dispute that intelligence agencies routinely use such cover.Also, at a time when Britain has become (in former French President Nicholas Sarkozy’s words) “an industrial wasteland”, such aid programmes keep scores of Britons employed.Fundamentalist agendaAmidst the volley of criticism, one of the few voices of support for aid to India comes from Christian Aid. This outfit has a vested interest in keeping the aid pipeline flowing smoothly. Christian Aid is part of a consortium that has managed a DFID programme directed at India’s backward classes and tribal communities that have traditionally been targeted for conversion by fundamentalist churches. The outfit, which has been operating in India for over 50 years, currently works in 16 states with 27 partners. (7)Christian Aid, which unabashedly mixes evangelism and charity, is selling its own brand of salvation in India’s backward regions, potentially setting up future religious clashes between Hindus and newly converted Christians. Its agenda is very clear – the church-backed organisation is openly meddling in deep-rooted social conflicts. Instead of letting India’s various social groups sort out their issues amicably, agencies like Christian Aid are creating discord. The rise of Maoist guerrilla movements, backed by fundamentalist churches based in the Anglosphere, is just one example.What about the poor?Britain doesn’t have to be concerned about India’s poor because: one, it has plenty of its own to worry about. The Guardian’s Breadline Britain series (8) notes the combination of soaring living costs (particularly food and childcare), welfare cuts, and charges for previously free services (such as homework clubs) have put Britons under immense, and in some cases, almost intolerable pressure. People affected include the low-income mum who ate once a day and never on Saturdays to ensure that her kids got a decent meal, for example; and the indignity of “just coping” – more than one interviewee reported “people fighting for the discounted vegetables” in the supermarket.And that’s not including the Peaceful Explosion – the massive increase in the number of Islamic fundamentalists who are invading white middle and lower class neighbourhoods, and the proliferation of child sex rings dominated by Pakistani immigrants.Secondly, at least 30-40 million Indians are lifted out of poverty every year thanks to India’s growing economy. This is an unprecedented rate of poverty removal that is bettered only by China. It is in this backdrop that Britain – along with its Anglosphere allies the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand and European sidekicks such as Norway, Germany and the Netherlands – continues to peddle the nonsense that India needs Western aid.Poverty is being removed from India through the hard work of leaders like Prime Minister Narendra Modi who are creating jobs and brand new cities. However, the rising India story doesn’t fit the Western narrative of a poor country that cannot survive without external aid. Too bad, other than some Gunga Dins for hire, Indians are not buying that any more.Some British politicians have pointed out the irony of British aid to India. When the statue frenzy hit the tabloids, Tory politician Philip Davies told the Express: “Here we are spending money in a country that has not only got its own space programme but is developing its own overseas aid programme….the public is not just sick and tired of this but angry too. It is completely unjustifiable and truly idiotic.”Davies was echoing what his colleague Douglas Carswell had said when Mukherjee gave London the finger: “The fact is that India’s economy is growing much faster than our own. We should be encouraging free trade with them and trying to learn from them rather than handing out patronising lectures.”Forget aid, get a lifeIndeed, Britain is not in a position to moralise because it alone is responsible for India’s poverty. Britain’s rapacious colonialism turned India from the world’s richest country in the 1700s to one of the poorest by the time the British were kicked out in 1947. Within the span of 190 years, the British also killed at least 60 million Indians through wars, displacement of populations and artificially created famines.Amaresh Misra, a writer and historian based in Mumbai, argues in his book War of Civilisations: India AD 1857 that after the First War of Independence in 1857, British reprisal killings (which he calls an “untold holocaust”) caused the deaths of almost 10 million people over the next 10 years.English author Charles Dickens, whose bicentennial is being celebrated this year, said after the 1857 war: “I wish I were commander-in-chief in India…I should proclaim to them that I considered my holding that appointment by the leave of God, to mean that I should do my utmost to exterminate the race.”And how can you forget the view of The Guardian, the liberal voice of Britain? “We sincerely hope that the terrible lesson thus taught will never be forgotten,” it wrote about the genocide.And finally, Winston Churchill, who described Indians as a “beastly race”. He caused the deaths of nearly four million Indians in 1943-44 by diverting food from India to Europe. It is known as the Great Bengal Famine during which the daily calorie intake of Indians was lower than that of the Jews in Germany’s death camps.Forget aid, what India needs from Britain is an apology.",Towering resentment: Why the British are sulking over the Statue of Unity,Post-Construction
"Six time Member of Parliament, Mansukh Vasava of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) resigned from the party on 29 December 2020 over a Union government notification that he said would adversely impact tribal communities in the Narmada basin. The next day, he retracted his resignation after a meeting with Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani. But the issues raised by him in the first place are not going to go away.A week before that, Vasava had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking the withdrawal of a circular issued by the Union Ministry for Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) notifying 121 villages, populated mainly by tribal communities, as an “eco-sensitive zone” where farming and forest-related activities would be curtailed, harming the interests of tribal people and farmers. Government officials, he had written, were harassing them, while seeking Modi’s intervention for the withdrawal of the circular.Vasava had written that officials were using the notification to interfere “in the private properties of tribal people”, who had not been taken into confidence and were preparing for a “mass protest”.These 121 villages are located in the vicinity of the Statue of Unity—the world’s largest statue, depicting Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and built at a cost of Rs.2,989 crore. Modi has been personally interested in developing the area into an “international tourist destination”.Vasava had written that officials were using the notification to interfere “in the private properties of tribal people”, who had not been taken into confidence and were preparing for a “mass protest”. Last Tuesday, he had sent his resignation to the Gujarat BJP chief, saying he did not want the image of the party to be damaged by his mistakes and announced his intention to resign as Member of Parliament. Curiously, when he retracted his resignation on Wednesday, these issues were not referred at all.Nevertheless, Vasava’s U-turn does not sweep away the fact that tribal people in these villages have been passing resolutions through their traditional “gram sabhas” against the MoEFCC notification. They have also begun preparing for a mass protest, compelling Dediapada BJP legislator Motilal Vasava to write letters to tribal village headmen supporting the resolutions.The movement against the notification began in early November, when the district administration served the first notice in respect of the MoEFCC order. There are several issues to be kept in mind. First, the order flies in the face of the Panchayat (Extension of Scheduled Areas) Act (PESA), 1996, which empowers gram sabhas in designated areas to be self-governing in respect of customary resources, minor forest produce, minor minerals, minor water bodies, selection of beneficiaries, sanction of projects, and control over local institutions. It mandates the sanction of the communities affected by proposed projects.Nevertheless, Vasava’s U-turn does not sweep away the fact that tribal people in these villages have been passing resolutions through their traditional “gram sabhas” against the MoEFCC notification.The affected villagers apprehend that the notification is the first step towards encroachment of pristine forests and will adversely affect their livelihoods. They are planning to move to the court, but given the balance of power and the prevailing political economy, are not optimistic of judicial redressal.These apprehensions are not misplaced given the record of the Union government. At this point, as a matter of fact, a movement is being mobilised in Goa against a trinity of “infrastructure” projects that would destroy the fragile and biodiverse ecosystem in the Western Ghats.In April last year, the standing committee of the National Board for Wildlife (NBW) cleared the doubling of a railway track, the expansion of a highway, and the installation of a new power transmission line. These will pass through Mollem National Park and the adjoining Bhagwan Mahaveer Sanctuary, together spread over 240 sq. km. The projects will splinter the sanctuaries by diverting 378 hectares of land and cutting some 40,000 trees. The two sanctuaries are host to several endangered wildlife species, including the pangolin, Bengal tigers, black panthers, and a great diversity of endemic species of flora and fauna, including the gaur (Indian bison), Goa’s state animal.At this point, as a matter of fact, a movement is being mobilised in Goa against a trinity of “infrastructure” projects that would destroy the fragile and biodiverse ecosystem in the Western Ghats.The projects are illegal on several counts, but have been approved, citing the old chestnuts of public and national interests. Affected villagers and advocacy groups in Goa have been protesting against these projects and litigation has been initiated both in the Bombay High Court and before a committee of the Supreme Court, but work on the railway tracks has already begun.Apart from the ecological concerns, citizens of Goa also feel that these projects, especially those related to the railway tracks and the highways, have been rammed down their throats by the Centre for a purpose that will bring little benefit to the state: the increased transportation of coal from Goa’s Mormugao Port to the steel mills in Karnataka.What is evident from the above instances are two important features of governance, evident since 2014: first, is the penchant for unilateralism and reign by fiat rather than consultation, consensus, and a respect for due process and statutory process of obtaining appropriate sanctions, by the infringement of the provisions of PESA; and, second, disregard for the rights of forest-dwellers, mostly tribal people, and environmental concerns, manifested in the short-circuiting of due process, to enable “development” projects.The projects are illegal on several counts, but have been approved, citing the old chestnuts of public and national interests.The first flows, of course, from Modi’s authoritarianism. His contempt for procedures and institutions, especially evident in the manner of passing the three farm laws which could well prove this regime’s nemesis, has been on display more times than can comfortably be counted. Demonetization, the rushed passage of the Goods and Services Tax, the imposition of a national lockdown at four hours’ notice, the manner in which the unconstitutional Citizenship (Amendment) Act was passed, the revocation of Article 370 and its aftermath, together testify not just Modi and his government’s absolutism, but also an addiction for grandstanding.As for a studious disregard for environmental and ecological concerns, the foregoing instances top a long litany of malfeasance. One important initiative has been the draft Environment Impact Assessment policy issued in May under the cover of the COVID-19 pandemic, which seeks to significantly water down the 2006 rules, making it easier for the government and private sector to implement projects without environmental scrutiny. It contravenes existing legislation and constitutional provisions.One observer has noted that the NBW, which is supposed to convene once a year, has not done so even once since Modi came to power in 2014. Its standing committee did, however, meet for the first time in April this year to clear 30 projects, 16 of them passing through national parks, sanctuaries and other eco-sensitive zones. To be fair, the two previous United Progressive Alliance’s record was not exactly burnished, but the first minister for environment, Jairam Ramesh in the UPA II government, made strenuous efforts to ensure compliance with environmental regulations, earning the disfavour of his ministerial colleagues. His successor, Jayanthi Natarajan, too, made an effort. The Modi government’s environment ministers, Prakash Javadekar, Harsh Vardhan and the late Anil Madhav Dave, have been indifferent, when not hostile, to environmental and ecological concerns.One observer has noted that the NBW, which is supposed to convene once a year, has not done so even once since Modi came to power in 2014.

"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday inaugurated a statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel with great pomp, and some potshots at those who have condemned the move.“I am surprised that some people in this country have the audacity to look at this event through a political lens. We are being criticised for praising the icons of this country as if we have committed a huge crime,” Modi said as he dedicated the 182-metre Statue of Unity to the nation.Gujarat governor O.P. Kohli, chief minister Vijay Rupani and BJP chief Amit Shah were present at the event that coincided with Patel’s 143rd birth anniversary.The Prime Minister said the towering structure, believed to be the tallest in the world, will serve as a reminder of the courage of a man who thwarted efforts to disintegrate India.Describing the monument as a symbol of the country’s engineering and technical capabilities, Modi said it will remind those who question India’s existence that this nation was, is and will remain eternal.“Had Sardar Patel not united the country, we would need visas to see lions at Gir or see the Charminar in Hyderabad,” the Prime Minister added.Modi also thanked the “tribals, farmers and villagers”, who helped make the statue possible. “Without your help and contribution, this would not be possible today. With the Statue of Unity, you (tribals and farmers) have enshrined your names in history too,” the Prime Minister said, adding that the statue will boost their livelihoods as it would bring business opportunities. “Because of tourism, when the world descends here, this region will prosper.”Local farmers and tribals, however, didn’t share Modi’s enthusiasm as they planned to stage protests against the government’s apathy. They are demanding their long overdue money for sugarcane they have sold to a mill that has shut down. The mill was, ironically, named after Patel.","Narendra Modi unveils Statue of Unity, makes a veiled attack on critics ",Pre-Construction

"Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated a 182-meter marvel named the Statue of Unity in honour of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel. The tallest statue in the world has been able to garner controversy proportionate to its size and grandeur. Beyond criticism on account of resources and appropriation of history in the name of Patel, this statue offers an opportunity for all of us to reflect on a phenomenon that is plaguing our democracies – idolizing political leaders.Sardar Patel for his ‘holy work of thwarting the conspiracy to disintegrate Mother India into pieces’ stands as the symbol of unity and the statue reaffirms the fact that India owes its territorial unity single-handedly to Sardar Patel. Certainly, his work and leadership were instrumental in bringing over 550 princely states together as one sovereign state. Perhaps, without his foresight and tact, unification of the country might have taken an absolutely different route.However, in making his name synonymous with the unity of independent India we are essentially defeating the underlying principle that drove his vociferous negotiations with princely states – that every little unit matters. In worshipping Patel for his leadership, we undermine the force of the collective will of the princely states which decided to join the Dominion of India, the overall spirit of nationalism exhibited by the population and the relentless efforts of his team.He, like all other leaders we end up worshipping, was doing his job as a tactful statesman. The leader is not an entity independent of the political support of the people he or she leads. The moment we idolise the leader alone, we are disassociating the leader from the masses. Such disassociation leads to a fake sense of reality, both for the leader and for the masses.This is not the first or the last time that we as a nation have idolised political leaders. From national movements to the nation-state, we have always been looking to be led by a charismatic personality. This is an undesirable feature of most democratic set-ups in the world. Overarching personalities become the symbol of the principles, values or issues of the system. We make real issues take refuge in personalities, we prioritize people over institutions. We place insurmountable faith in their capabilities and reason more than the institutions which they are mandated to lead. This kind of symbolic politics can be called into question for multiple reasons.Firstly, this places tremendous amounts of power in the hands of one or a few. History is full of lessons to be learnt from this mistake of outsourcing absolute power to an individual. The sense of belief in an individual’s authority being superior to the rule of law is often the starting point of excesses one can commit as a person in power.Distinction must always be made between a person in power and person exercising temporary control in a situation. The leader is not the train but a mere driver. A well-engineered train can manage quite well with even reasonably good driver, however, even the best driver cannot operate a train which lacks basic machinery. The durability of an administrative setup of democratic institutions can considerably reduce the instrumentality of a leader.Secondly, the reverence towards politicians is also indicative of a lack of thought in the decision making of the democratic process. The politics of rhetoric appeals to the emotion more than the rationality of an average voter. In an indirect democracy the choice of our vote, hence the elected candidate, is the single most important decision we take every five years. We are taking the easy way out if we choose to cast our vote in favor of an over-arching personality, while ignoring the ideology, the policies and actions of the political party on relevant issues.Certainly, there are other possibilities. A country can find a more inclusive symbol of unity which goes beyond a person. A symbol which can showcase the country’s engineering and technical qualities equally well. Similarly, we can run election campaigns solely on issues rather than on individual traits. We should take this opportunity to reflect that when we are taking shelter of the fact that there is no alternative, are we really admitting that a 1.3 billion strong democracy lacks the imagination of addressing its own issues?",Reflections on the Statue of Unity                            ,Post-Construction
"Ever since the unveiling of the Statue of Unity (SoU) on 31st October 2018 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, there has been a huge criticism of the government overspending Rs 2,989 crores for a statue and that, the money could have been used for other developmental processes. The claim that the money could have been used legitimately for other developmental activities is a far contested one. Since the statue is already an existing one now, there are other questions that must bother us, that is, about the symbolism attached to the monument and its birth in times of irony.UnityThe social and political atmosphere of contemporary India is deeply fragmented majorly due to issues arising from religious and ideological intolerance. During the inauguration of Statue of Unity, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi boasted about Sardar Patel’s contribution to India’s unity and encouraged the countrymen to ‘Run for Unity’; under his leadership the country was still divided by the Ram temple issue, the Sabarimala judgment, the ongoing mob lynching and cow vigilantism cases and the rift in crucial institutions of governance.Moreover, the political class adds to the polarization by reducing great leaders of history to their favourable ideologies and in effect creating a divide among those personalities too, at least this is what is portrayed to the youth who easily get influenced by the narrative formed. It is a well-known fact that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Jawaharlal Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi disagreed with each other at various events, but, they respected their differences and worked towards a common goal without contempt of any kind. To talk about any one of them, one needs to mention their contemporaries too because they complement and complete each other.Unfortunately, PM Modi in his inauguration speech completely failed to mention Sardar Patel’s contemporaries. A notable point was mentioned on Twitter by Girish Kuber, editor of Loksatta, that it would have been magnanimous to have all party veterans for the inauguration ceremony. Indeed, it would have been an effective gesture of restoring communicable relations among the political parties by inviting all for the inauguration ceremony of the Statue of Unity. The statue, then, would have been hopefully inspiring to the political parties to work in unison in matters of development and governance.DevelopmentThe Statue of Unity is a perfect tourism site with a grand museum, audio-visual gallery, research centres, plush hotels, recreational spots and all the attractive services that a tourist could ask for. In just eleven days of its opening, it attracted over 1.28 lakh tourists. The underlying themes and objectives associated with the Statue of Unity focus on tribal development, employment generation, livelihood generation and overall socio-economic development of the less privileged communities of the region. Contradictorily, the immediate impact on the tribal communities has been greatly dismal in terms of unfulfilled rehabilitation and employment promises to the villagers who lost their land to the grandiosity of the statue.On 12th November 2018, over 100 farmers from around six villages staged the dharna at the Statue of Unity complex; demanding jobs at the SoU. Moreover, the statue had been inaugurated in the face of protests, bandhs, burnt properties and the detainment of around 90 activists who fought for the rights of the tribes. It would be too early to evaluate the results of the developmental activities, if ever undertaken, under the Statue of Unity project. At present, it can be satisfactorily said that, as per Narendra Modi’s vision, the Statue of Unity can definitely serve as a source of inspiration momentarily for the one who visits the site. However, this is achieved at the cost of betraying the tribal people and villagers in the adjoining areas by grabbing on their land and means of survival. This is simply another act of failing the man who himself strongly advocated and fought for the rights of the peasants in the villages of Gujarat.A Tribute full of shamIn the whole debate surrounding the Statue of Unity, it is the personality and principles of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel that has been in the grinding particularly through social media. The entire episode proved to be greatly disrespecting to the man’s contribution to the making of independent India. In an India where most of the times history is revisited by its political class only to distort it and to use it as a tool for further polarization of the society, driven by self-interests or self-victimization, the stature of Sardar Patel seems to be reduced to a faded monument or an object of tourism symbolizing values that are greatly ironical to the reality.For a modest and humble leader like Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel who fulfilled the great task of unifying India; a grand Statue of Unity standing in a divided India amidst protests and discontent majorly among tribes and farmers, certainly failed to uphold his way of life and values. In such distress, the Prime Minister’s gift to the nation is neither a genuine nor a befitting tribute to the Ironman of India!",Statue of Unity or Statue of Irony?,Post-Construction

"A year after its inauguration on October 31, 2018, by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Statue of Unity (SoU) is undergoing maintenance with several teams of cleaners perched on the statue by way of magnetic ropes and rope-suspended platforms to clean the world’s tallest statue of 182 metres. Officials of the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd (SSNNL) refuted reports that the statue is undergoing a “structural modification”, but say that the SoU — which has a bronze cladding — will gradually change its colour from the existing brown to green, eventually settling at a shade of grey.According to SoU officials, the maintenance and cleaning activities have been undertaken by deploying trained personnel to physically clean the statue from head to toe, literally. Refuting reports that the statue is undergoing a structural modification in order to make the bronze cladding “openable” for maintenance purposes, SSNNL officials said that removable panels of the cladding have been in place throughout the structure, since the design’s inception.Chief Engineer PC Vyas told this newspaper, “There are many portions of the approximately 6,600 pieces of the bronze cladding which are removable to allow maintenance staff to reach the facade of the statue. This was in place since the design stage and there is no structural modification being made right now. The cleaning staff which is well-trained is going about the statue’s cleaning with the help of magnetic ropes and wire suspended platforms, wherever they can be put.”Vyas said that while some removable panels are part of the chest of the statue, which also houses the viewing gallery, the head of the statue is accessible only to the maintenance teams by design. “The cleaners are able to reach all parts of the statue, including the exterior of the face, with help of magnetic-climbing systems which include a special pair of shoes as well as hand grips, especially meant for climbing metal surfaces and tall structures. No special chemicals are being used to clean the statue, as this activity is primarily undertaken to only clean the surface of dirt, blemish and bird droppings,” he said.Apart from the dust that may have settled in the crevices of the labels put together as the exterior facade of the statue, the authorities are aware that many parts of the statue’s bronze cladding are beginning to turn green, owing to its natural property of oxidation. Top officials of SSNNL said that the design teams had also prepared a projection of how the statue’s look would change over the years, as the bronze completes its process of natural oxidation to form patina — the green-ish tarnish which also lends the sturdy metal its artistic feel.“Just like the Statue of Liberty in the US, which is made of copper and has turned into the present day green-ish colour that it is now recognised by, the Statue of Unity will also change its colour over the years. The bronze, which mainly consists of copper as part of its alloy composition, reacts with the atmosphere as a natural process and tarnishes over time. For many statues across the world, this tarnish actually lends depth to the art. We have estimated that the statue will turn green-ish over the next few decades,” Vyas added.","A year after its inauguration, SoU undergoes maintenance",Post-Construction
"The Tallest in the WorldAt 182 meters from the road entry and 208.5 meters from the river entry, the SoU will be the tallest statue in the world; taller than the 153 m tall Spring Temple Buddha in China and almost twice as tall as the world famous Statue of Liberty in New York.

Situated right in the middle of the river Narmada, the statue is exposed to the tunnel effect of winds blowing down the river. Studies of wind patterns over the years revealed wind speeds of 39 m per second (roughly translated into 130 km/hr. ) could buffet the statue in a worst-case scenario.The statue has been engineered to withstand wind speeds of up to 50 m per second (almost 180 km/hr. ). The challenge is not only of the wind blowing against the statue but the succession effect it creates at the back of the statue that had to considered in the structural design.To arrest any sway of such a tall structure, two Tuned Mass Dampers of 250 tonnes each have been used. In any given situation, all the four corners of the base raft remain rooted to the ground.The SoU can also survive earthquakes measuring up to 6.5 on the Richter Scale, at a depth of 10 km and within a radius of 12 km of the statue.Walking pose of the SardarThe Sardar’s legs are clad in a dhoti, his feet in chappals and in a walking pose that means that the statue is most slender at the base. This goes against the norms of what other tall statues have followed. The walking pose also opened up a gap of 6.4 meters between the two feet which then had to be tested to withstand wind velocity.The faceAnother challenge came in the form of the look of the statue. Since Patel’s face was an important aspect, special care was taken in casting the facial features that had to be as close as possible to the Sardar’s face. As per the sculptor Ram Sutar’s original design, the statue was to have a poised countenance, with Patel’s head held high and arms by his sides emitting a feeling of power as well as warmth. The statue is also supposed to appear as if it is walking on water, towards the Sardar Sarovar dam, with its left leg slightly forward.The actual features of the Sardar were decided through a participative exercise involving thousands of people. A mock-up was created and exhibited for people to see and comment on it.Movement of Men and MaterialThe statue is located amidst remote, mountainous terrain, which posed enormous difficulties in delivery of materials. A temporary Bailey’s bridge connected the hill to the mainland.The statue base also stands above the highest flood level recorded over a 100-year period of the nearby Narmada dam. A detailed hydrological study was conducted by a specialist consultant to ascertain the river level and flow during various conditions.Altogether, the statue is divided into five zones. Up to its shin is the first zone, comprising three levels, including an exhibit floor, mezzanine and roof. It will contain a Memorial Garden and a large museum.Zone 2 extends up to the statue’s thighs at 149 metres, while Zone 3 goes up to the viewing gallery at 153 metres.Zone 4 and Zone 5 would be out of reach of visitors, with Zone 4 comprising the maintenance area and Zone 5 the head and shoulders.The viewing gallery will be accessible through two elevators located in the statue’s core, with a carrying capacity of 40 people each. The gallery, with space to accommodate up to 200 people at a time, will have a view of the Satpura and Vindhyachal mountain ranges, which also form the point where Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra meet. Visitors can also get a distant view of the Sardar Sarovar Reservoir, and the 12-km-long Garudeshwar Reservoir — the latter will help ensure there is always water around the statue, which is located downstream from the Narmada dam.In the lobby area at the entrance of the statue, a Museum and Audio Visual Gallery will feature 15-minute presentations on the life of Patel and the tribal culture of Gujarat, to entertain tourists awaiting their turn to go up.The ’loha’ and earth campaignsOn December 15, 2013, the then Gujarat CM Narendra Modi had flagged off the campaign to 1,69,000 villages, carrying about three lakh empty kit boxes, to collect soil and scrap-iron farm implements. Subsequently, by 2016, 135 metric tonnes of iron were collected in various forms that have been used in the making of the statue. The collected earth from all parts of the country has been used in the making of the symbolic Unity Wall, and the Suraj Petitions received from this campaign are presented in digital, graphical form in the exhibition hall.",The Statue of Unity | Sardar Patel | L&T - Larsen & Toubro,Pre-Construction

The developed Water Aerodromes at Statue of Unity was officially inaugurated by Hon’ble Prime Minister on 31 Oct. 2020.",SEAPLANE OPERATION STARTS AT STATUE OF UNITY,Post-Construction
"It has been more than one year since the construction of the Statue of Unity So I feel it quite right time to analyze how its performance has been Was it successful? Or was it a failure? Come let us analyse it by looking at the complete data of its 1st year performances.In the official press of the Statue of Unity released on 11th November, there is a data that reads that from 31st October, 2018 up til 1st November 2019 that is, exactly in between the period of one year, 27 lakh tourists came to visit it 2.7 million tourists came to see it in the first year The revenue generation because of these tourists in one year was 80.66 crore rupees.From it Keeping in mind these numbers, can we conclude that the Statue of Unity has been a profitable and successful project? To see the success , you need to see its return on investment Return on investment is how much money you’ve invested and how much money you’re getting back So 3000 crore Rupees were invested in the Statue of Unity and per year, 80 crore rupees are coming back by a return rate of 2.7%.What does this 2.7% mean? If you’d deposited Rs 3000 crore in a bank, then you’d get 6%return on investment in a savings bank account…….😲 Even if you had merely let such a huge amount of money lie dormant in a bank, then too, it would generate more profit than the statue of unity. An even more critical fact in the inflation rate You must already know how the value of money decreases with time due to inflation. At an average inflation rate in India in last 10 years is around 5% And do understand that if the return on investment on anything is lesser than the inflation rate, then you’re bearing a loss there. And the same thing prevails with the statue of unity Inflation rate is 5%. Return on investment of statue of liberty is 2.7% And it would be very difficult to maintain this rate of the return on investment as by each passing year number of tourist visiting it it will reduce. This means that the 3,000 crore rupees that have been squandered will never be recovered It will never be able to recover its cost due to inflation as in coming years the return rate will also decrease .And you must have a lot of advertisement for attracting tourist towards it. In the first two months, 2 crores were spent to run ads for the statue of unity to publicize it in front of people Over this, add on the employee paying cost, repairing cost and maintenance cost…………..and so on. Now think a little is it profitable….???? Talking about maintenance, last year there was flooding in the statue of unity when it was raining nearby When it rained nearby, the area in the statue- the viewing area got flooded When they were asked why this was happening, they said that this wasn’t a defect We have designed it in such a way that this will happenHear on, They invested a further of 2 crore rupees to construct the statue of a 30 feet high dinosaur And within a week, that statue collapsed shocked…….really. Are people not coming to see the statue of unity that you’re constructing another one and investing money in it? And then too, the quality of the statue was so that even after spending 2 crore rupees, it collapsed This kind of quality means that there would be huge costs of maintenance and repair in the coming years. Summing up, upon seeing the data of one year, we can conclude that is Statue of Unity it is a big loss But the government will never admit this fact The ministers sitting in the government… What do I tell you? They talk such pretentious talks You’d be suprised to hear Piyush Goyal ji says that in the next 4-5 years, The Statue of Unity would generate a revenue of 1 lakh crores every year… 1 lakh crores! Let us look at some Maths regarding this I know that Piyush Goyal ji does not like a lot of Maths because according to him, while discovering gravity, Einstein never used Maths …”Don’t get into those Maths…” “those Maths have never helped Einstein discover gravity” said my Piyush ji really (can visit Piyush Goyal ji video saying the same Now I know what some people will comment here They might say that the Statue of Unity may not be a good return of investment in terms of money But it is a very good tourist site, it is giving jobs to people So many people are getting employment because of it But this logic does not fit well Because had that been the main purpose, if giving jobs and employment to the people was the main purpose, then it could’ve been done in a better way The government could have opened a skill development centre instead of constructing a statue, which would enable more people to get jobs.The tip for for your personal investment from the above discussion is that if you invest money somewhere and the return of investment is lesser than the inflation rate, then you need to understand that this means a loss of money for you For example if a friend tells you to invest in his business and promises to pay you a certain sum back every year He promises a certain amount of profit every year Then you have yo see how much money you have invested, and what percentage of it you are getting back each year So this is a a very small but basic personal finance tip that is valid every where regardless of whether you invest it in gold, property, FD or mutual funds. This is all from the article I hope it helped you to aware of the reality. I just request you to share it a lot so that everyone an can access and be aware of this information which is too important for every citizen",Statue Of Unity A Success Or Failure,Post-Construction
"Rajpipla: Rainwater made its way into the viewing gallery of the Statue of Unity in Gujarat, with tourists sharing videos of puddles on the floor and water dripping off the roof.Several of those who shared videos on social media, however, expressed displeasure.The Statue of Unity, a 182-metre memorial to Sardar Patel in Kevadiya in Narmada district, is the tallest structure of its kind in the world and was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 31 last year. ""We had come with great hope to see the worlds tallest statue. But we are feeling bad looking at the statue in the rain. It has not rained heavily, and already the main hall and viewing gallery of the statue is filled with water. It is unfortunate,"" a tourist at the site told reporters.However, the official handle of Statue of Unity claimed that rainwater in the viewing gallery was blown by high-velocity winds.The viewing gallery, at a height of 135 metres, has a grill frontage which allows winds to blow in water during heavy rains, said officials.""The viewing gallery is open with grills on the chest of the statue. The rear side of the gallery is covered by glass. The front view is open as per design. So it is natural that water will enter when it rains,"" said Narmada Collector IK Patel.Patel, who is also the chief administrator of the Statue of Unity, added, ""There is a channel to dispose of rain water. But when the wind speed is more, lots of water comes in and house-keeping personnel continuously drain it out. It is not leakage as is being claimed.""","Leaking Roof at Statue of Unity Leaves Tourists Drenched, Officials Say It’s Design Not Defect",Post-Construction

"The headmen of 22 villages situated near the Sardar Sarovar Dam Monday wrote an open letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi stating that villagers would not welcome him at the inauguration of the Statue of Unity on October 31.Local tribal leaders have also announced a boycott of the function citing destruction of natural resources due to the memorial.The Statue of Unity, a memorial to Sardar Patel, is situated on an islet and, at 182 metres, is touted as the world's tallest statue.""These forests, rivers, waterfalls, land and agriculture supported us for generations. We survived on them. But, everything is being destroyed now and celebrations are also planned. Don't you think its akin to celebrating someone's death? We feel so,"" the letter, having common content and signed by sarpanchas of 22 villages, stated.""We all villagers want to tell you with extreme grief that we will not welcome you on October 31. Even if you come here like an unwanted guest, you are not welcome here,"" it added.They alleged that people's hard-earned money is being wasted on projects like Statue of Unity though several villages of the area are still deprived of basic facilities like schools, hospitals and drinking water.""If Sardar Patel could see the mass destruction of natural resources and injustice done to us, he would cry. When we are raising our issues, we are persecuted by police.

But, there was no ban on the construction of canal network. But, instead of completing the network, BJP only did politics. Thus, canals having cumulative length of of 20,000 kms are yet to be constructed"" Dhanani said in the letter.Former Gujarat CM Shankersinh Vaghela demanded that the contribution of all the royals who had ""gifted"" their princely states to build a united India after independence, should get a mention in the museum built beneath the Statue of Unity.He attacked Modi saying that the statue is just a ""marketing tool"" for the ruling BJP and demanded that plight of tribals and poor must be heard first.",Statue of Unity: Gujarat villagers write open letter to protest PM Modi's visit,Pre-Construction
"By a strange coincidence, the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, the ‘Iron Man’ of India, coincides with the martyrdom day of the ‘Iron Lady’ and ‘Woman of the Millennium’ Indira Gandhi. On this day, the Prime Minister unveiled the 182-meter-tall statue of Vallabhbhai Patel on the banks of Narmada, near Vadodara district of Gujarat, a state known all over the world as the birth place of Mahatma Gandhi, the apostle of truth and nonviolence. Ideally, and ethically, it is Gandhiji’s statue that would have been a better tribute to Sardar Patel who was amongst the most devoted followers of the Mahatma.Now that the tallest statue in the world is a ground reality and likely to become a popular tourism spot, what will it symbolise to the present and future generations? Of all the images of India’s first Deputy Prime Minister, and Home Minister, the one that stands out, and will continue to do so, is his unforgettable contribution in integrating 562 princely states into an newly independent India. Former Prime Minister Morarji Desai wrote in 1985: “He was called upon to tackle the most intricate and baffling problem of the states’ integration into the Union of India. And it is here that his tact, his powers of persuasion and statesmanship came into full play.”Patel’s task was however made easier by two other factors: Jawaharlal Nehru, before becoming Prime Minister, had threatened the princes that he will launch public agitations in their states if they don’t accede to India. The last Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, had laid the groundwork for Patel before the latter was sworn into Nehru’s cabinet. Mountbatten regularly met the princes and used all his charm and force of his personality to persuade the princes to give up their kingdoms. An ailing Sardar Patel, in June, 1948, had the magnanimity to acknowledge this when Mountbatten came to bid him farewell before leaving India. This is recorded by the authors of the Freedom at Midnight when they interviewed Mountbatten, a quarter of a century after Independence. In his interview, Mountbatten quotes the Sardar telling him affectionately: “I don’t think you realise that but for you, we’d never have got a solution. We would have had bloodshed and trouble and we’d probably still be stuck under British rule. I don’t think enough has been done to recognise it.”The Bardoli Satyagraha of 1928 led by Sardar Patel is etched in the memory of people of Gujarat who take pride in recallinghis services for the poor peasants of Bardoli taluka in Surat district. It was a landmark in the country’s struggle for freedom which earned Vallabhbhai Patel the title of ‘Sardar’ and made him popular throughout the country. So great was the impact that Pandit Motilal Nehru suggested Vallabhbhai’s name to Gandhiji for presidency of the Congress scheduled for December, 1928 in Calcutta (now Kolkata).On July 11, 1928, the elder Nehru wrote to the Mahatma: “I am quite clear that the hero of the hour is Vallabhbhai and the least we can do is to offer him the crown.” Rejecting the suggestion, Gandhiji instead chose Motilal Nehru himself as the president for the second time. He had earlier presided over the 1919 Amritsar session of the Congress held after the infamous Jalianwala Massacre. Rajmohan Gandhi, in his biography of Patel, writes: “If Vallabhbhai was the hero of 1928, and Jawaharlal and Subhas were attracting the youth, Motilal had earned the acclaim for his attempt to draft a constitution for India acceptable to all parties and communities.”Lahore (1929) and Karachi (1931) are perhaps the two most important landmark sessions of the Congress before the Quit India Movement. It was here that Mahatma Gandhi chose his two ablest lieutenants to preside. Forty-year-old Jawaharlal Nehru, with his magnetic appeal amongst the youth, was nominated by Gandhi for the Lahore session of INC where for the first time, the call was given for Poorna Swaraj (complete independence). Sardar Patel, now 56, was chosen by his mentor to preside over the Karachi Session where not only the Gandhi–Irwin Pact was ratified, but the resolution on Fundamental Rights drafted by Jawaharlal Nehru was adopted. Many of the points in the resolution were later incorporated in the Constitution of free India. To the impatient youth of India, some of whom had shown him and Gandhiji black flags for the latter’s alleged inability to stop the execution of Bhagat Singh, the Sardar uttered these words in his concluding address: “Gandhiji is now almost 63 years old. I am 56. Should we, the old, be anxious for Independence or you, the young! We are interested in seeing India free before we die. We are far more in a hurry than you.”The question of India’s prime ministership was settled by Mahatma Gandhi many years before Independence, and more than once. On January 25, 1942, months before the Quit India Movement, Gandhiji declared: “…I have said for some years and say now that not Rajaji, not Sardar Patel but Jawaharlal Nehru will be my successor.” Yet, 71 years after Independence, and 68 years after Patel’s death, vested interests keep quipping that it was unfair that Patel was not chosen as the Prime Minister. They forget even if he had become, it would have been a short lived tenure of three years and, in his failing health, he might not have done full justice to his heavy responsibilities. Nobody more than Gandhiji and Patel himself were aware of this reality. As Rajmohan Gandhi, in his extremely absorbing book The Good Boatman, has written: “… the India of Gandhi, Patel and Nehru was different from the India that today debates the question of Nehru versus Patel. Its sentiments and moods were different. In ‘nominating’ Jawaharlal, Gandhi did not override public opinion - for representing and uniting Indians of all ages, classes and religions, Jawaharlal seemed more suitable than Vallabhbhai.”There were, no doubt, differences between Nehru and Patel on various problems, both before and after Independence, but these were much less than the major issues on which they thought alike. For example, Patel supported Nehru on special status for Kashmir and on the Nehru-Liaqat Accord for which the Deputy Prime Minister spent six days in Calcutta, appealing to the people of West Bengal to support Jawaharlal Nehru.Earlier, on the eve of Independence, the Prime Minister in–waiting, Nehru, had invited Patel to join his cabinet stressing the fact that the Sardar was ‘its strongest pillar’. Patel wrote back: “My services will be at your disposal, I hope for the rest of my life, and you will have unquestioned loyalty and devotion from me in the cause for which no man in India has sacrificed as much as you have done. Our combination is unbreakable and therein lies our strength.”It is this combination that certain vested interests are trying to portray as untrue for their selfish political ends. The Sardar statue may serve the purpose of putting an end to such mischief as true historical facts cannot be hidden for long. Thanks to the Sangh Parivar’s obsession with Sardar Patel, the young generations have come to know, which they may have never known, that it was the ‘Iron Man’ of India who put the entire RSS in jail for their suspected role in Gandhi’s murder, and castigated them for distributing sweets after his assassination. He released them only after they gave a written assurance that they will refrain from political activities and adhere to nonviolence. The great Sardar died on Dec 1950, and, within a year, the RSS announced the formation of its political wing, the Bhartiya Jan Sangh. More than anything else, the tallest statue in the world will remind us of this broken promise.",Sardar Patel statue: A failed attempt to rewrite history,Pre-Construction

"Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is on a two-day visit to Kevadia in Narmada district — his first visit to the state since the pandemic struck — inaugurated 17 tourism projects around the Statue of Unity complex and laid foundation stones for four upcoming projects.Modi, who was accompanied by Chief Minister Vijay Rupani and Governor Acharya Devvrat, rode the train and indulged in games at the Children’s Nutrition Park, cruised in a jetty along the six-kilometre navigation channel downstream Narmada River and petted animals and birds at the Sardar Patel Kevadia Zoological Park — projects that were slated for inauguration on March 26 but were postponed due to the Covid outbreak.October 31, which is Sardar Patel’s birthday, is being celebrated as Ekta Divas and the projects in the precincts of the statue now called the “Kevadia tourism circuit” have been themed around “unity”.Scheduled to visit Kevadia Friday afternoon, Modi advanced his tour and arrived early to meet the families of former chief minister Keshubhai Patel who died Thursday and the Gujarati singer-actor duo Mahesh Kanodia and brother Naresh who died of Covid-19 earlier in the week.Modi began his Kevadia visit by inaugurating the Aarogyavan, which has over 1,000 species of medicinal and herbal plantations, including a lotus-shaped indoor plants pavillion, and took a tour of the gardens on a golf cart with a face mask on, except at a couple of “selfie points”, where he stopped to take pictures.The PM interacted with the women’s self-help groups from 331 families that will run the Aarogya Cafe — a health cafeteria where tourists will be able to purchase herbal items sourced mainly from the rich forests and villages around the Statue of Unity.Modi, who spent close to an hour at each of the projects, rode the train at the Children’s Nutrition Park, running along a 600-metre track and five themed station stoppages —Phalshaka Griham, Payonagari, Annapoorna, Poshan Puram and Swastha Bharatam, featuring cuisines from across India. Each of the stations has a mascot — Kumar Kisan, a puppet farmer who tells the story of how he grows fruits and vegetables at Phalshakha, an animated cow grazer Janardhan at Payonagri, who explains the importance of milk and a doting mother at Annapoorna station.Modi also watched a five-minute 5D movie on India’s “unity in food diversity”. He also inaugurated the two-storeyed Ekta Mall, spread over 35,000 sq ft that houses handicrafts and handlooms from across the country.At the Jungle Safari, touted as the “fastest-built safari in the world”, and the geodesic dome for aviary, “the largest in the world”, Modi spent time petting a macaw and went on the cruise downstream the Narmada river.Among the projects was the SoU website in UN languages, Glow Garden and the Special Lighting at the Narmada Dam. The Prime Minister also laid the foundation stone for the government quarters and an administrative building coming up in the vicinity following the implementation of the Statue of Unity Area Development and Tourism Governance Authority. The Gujarat assembly, had last year passed a bill to set up a Statue of Unity Tourism Authority which will notify a designated tourism development area around the SoU.He also laid the foundation stone for quarters of the State Reserve Police Force as well as the Adarsh Gam, which has been proposed by the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd (SSNNL) to relocate close to 1,000 beneficiaries of the six villages around the Statue of Unity, who have been agitating against the acquisition of their lands.On Saturday, Modi will inaugurate the water aerodrome project connecting Statue of Unity to Sabarmati Riverfront in Ahmedabad by taking the seaplane ride back to Ahmedabad after addressing the trainee officers of Lal Bahadur Shastri Academy of Administration (LBSNAA) from the exhibition hall of the Statue of Unity via live video-conferencing.Narmada district has been identified by the NITI Aayog as the “aspirational district” with special focus on the indicators monitoring not only the infrastructure or economic returns but also social indicators like health, education, women empowerment, nutrition and local ecology. The Statue of Unity has till date attracted more than 44 lakh tourists, after its launch on October 31, 2018.A pre-Covid study carried out by the Institute of Competitiveness has projected this figure to further increase to 40 lakh in 2020, 53.6 lakhs in 2021 and 68.6 lakh in 2022, as per a report of the SSNNL.As per the NSSO Tourism Survey 2017 report, the average expenditure per tourist for a holiday trip in India is Rs 1,445. At this rate, integrated development of Kevadia is expected to create a direct economic impact of Rs 2,861.68 crore during 2020-2022 and an indirect impact of Rs. 6,127.14 crore considering output multiplier of 2.1411. The study has concluded that “Kevadia Eco-system will generate a cumulative economic impact (direct and indirect combined) of around Rs 9,000 crore (2020-2022),” the report states.",Statue of Unity gets a tourism boost; PM launches 17 projects,Post-Construction

Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the gigantic statue of Vallabhbhai Patel, the country's first home minister, on October 31, 2018.""I see the Statue of Unity creating an economic ecosystem around it worth at least ₹ one lakh crore in the years to come,"" the railway minister told reporters. Mr Goyal, who took a stock of the construction of a new railway station at Kevadiya and laying of a new line connecting the town with Vadodara, announced that high-speed shuttle trains will operate between the two stations.""Laying of tracks has already begun at some spots. Work would start on other stretches by March....Once it is connected with the mainline (at Vadodara), tourists from across the country would be able to come Kevadiya,"" he said.""We are planning to implement ""hub and spokes"" model. People arriving at the mainline (Vadodara) would be ferried to Kevadiya using fast trains on the sub-line, so that people can reach here in very little time. We would run such shuttle services throughout the day,"" the railway minister said.He expressed confidence that land acquisition for Kevadiya-Vadodara railway line would be completed by March.8 Comments Later, Mr Goyal met Chief Minister Vijay Rupani in Gandhinagar and reviewed the progress of various railway projects in Gujarat, an official release said.",Statue Of Unity Will Create ₹ 1 Lakh Crore Economic Ecosystem: Piyush Goyal,Post-Construction
"Is the Statue of Unity an unwise investment? Was making Devdas with Madhuri Dixit, Aishwarya Rai and Shah Rukh Khan an unwise investment? This glossy, glamorous, pathos-filled movie was released in July 2002. Films and statues are often viewed with derision. Memorials and mausoleums are regarded with deadly suspicion. Do they serve any economic purpose?At the time of its release, Devdas was the most expensive Hindi movie ever produced in India. This infuriated economists and commoners. They held the view that its producers and its director, Sanjay Bhansali, had burned money. Should poor India spend wastefully and unwisely on a colourful movie that had gorgeous costumes, dazzling lights and fabulous fake homes made of plywood, cardboard and canvas? Could the money have been spent productively and wisely? Could the money have been spent to build real homes and educate real children, say, in Dharavi?The times have not changed. Sardar Patel’s statue has set off a wave of ridicule. The Statue of Unity stands amazingly tall on a river island in the Narmada. It celebrates Sardar Patel’s pivotal contribution to a complex task in a turbulent era. Sardar Patel (1875-1950) had initiated the territorial and administrative unification of 562 princely states into the Republic of India.",Statue of Unity is a political and economic symbol,Post-Construction
"As Prime Minister Narendra Modi gets ready to unveil the world’s tallest statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel at Kevadiya in Gujarat, the Bharatiya Janata Party, through its organisation and state governments, has been working overtime to sell the ‘Statue of Unity’ project to the masses at an ideological level. The project is extremely important for the long-term political goals of the Sangh parivar.But the project has failed to generate euphoria among the masses, something that Modi and his team have been vying for since the idea was floated. The euphoria is not just missing across the country, but even in Gujarat, where the tribals are threatening to stage a major protest on October 31, Patel’s 143rd birth anniversary, when the statue is to be unveiled.The entire project is being viewed as yet another part of the Sangh parivar’s move not only to appropriate Patel and his legacy but to pit the ‘Iron Man’ against both Jawaharlal Nehru, whom its has vilified to a large extent, and also against Mahatma Gandhi, who was the other and more towering figure from Gujarat.Observers have also pointed out how there is a distinct similarity between the manner in which the BJP had carried out its movement for building a Ram Temple in Ayodhya in the late 1980s and the movement for building Sardar Patel’s statue.“The tools utilised were the same. There were yatras for both projects. While bricks were collected for the proposed temple in Ayodhya, this time they carried out a drive to collect iron pieces from across the country for this statue. They never came clear on the money and bricks collected for the temple. In the same way, officials in Gujarat never divulged how many tonnes of iron were actually collected. The media always shied from reporting whether this iron collection drive was a success or not,” said an Ahmedabad-based political observer.“In both cases, the projection was to create something. But what was achieved was the destruction of another. They said that they wanted to build a Ram temple but what was carried out was destruction of Babri Mosque. In this case also the message was that a statue of Patel is being erected but in the process it is destroying Nehru and projecting Patel as someone even taller than Gandhi,” he added.Eminent social scientist and author Achyut Yagnik points out, “Other than Gandhi, who had given up active politics, there were three stalwarts of the freedom movement – Nehru, Patel and Subhas Chandra Bose. The process is on to appropriate the latter two and then pit them against Nehru.”Patel has been important for the BJP as well as its earlier avatar, the Bhartiya Jan Sangh, that was born in 1951 because they never had any leader in the freedom struggle as their referral point, he said.He also agreed to the observation that the BJP or Sangh Parivar has always projected Patel as an ‘autocrat’ and not as a ‘democrat’ while playing to their support base.The point about Patel BJP highlights the most is his role in the merger of the 562 princely states into India. But nobody brings up the fact that Patel was among the most dedicated followers of Gandhi and that he never went outside Gandhian influence.An ‘autocratic’ image of Patel as their ideal has helped the Sangh Parivar achieve its political motives in electoral terms in Gujarat. The narrative of the leaders including Modi has always centred around that the country’s problems including the burning Kashmir issue would not have been there if Patel was made the first prime minister of the country.Yagnik pointed out, “What is not remembered is that Patel’s image was built step by step. He was the mayor of Ahmedabad who left local politics to move to Bardoli. At the same time, his brother Vitthalbhai Patel was the mayor of Bombay.”The politics over the appropriation of Patel and his legacy first gathered pace under the tenure of Chimanbhai Patel as the chief minister of Gujarat and further accelerated during BJP’s tenure that has lasted more than two decades.Lack of euphoriaComing back to the failure of Modi government and the BJP to generate euphoria about the project, this reporter was in for a surprise to see the Statue of Unity being promoted in the ‘Incredible India’ series of tourism promotion at a cinema hall in Himachal Pradesh. The promotional aspect, as far as a tourism destination is concerned, is fine but this is perhaps the only promotional video of ‘Incredible India’ that also promotes Modi. It also contains political overtones carrying forward BJP’s narrative on Patel with the claim that without Patel and his role in unifying modern day India, people would have to obtain a visa to go to Junagadh.But why is the government using such a platform to promote Modi and the BJP’s political narrative in a tourism promotion video meant for mass circulation?One simply needs to understand the opposition coming for the project from within Gujarat. About a fortnight back it was the former Chief Minister Suresh Mehta reportedly claiming that the memorial depicting Sardar Patel is ‘illegal’ and the government went ahead with the project despite protests from local tribals only to garner votes for the saffron party.Addressing a media briefing, Mehta had said that 5,000 tribal families in 72 villages in the vicinity of the memorial would observe a day’s fast on October 31 to register their protest.Reports say that nearly 75,000 tribals whose land was taken for the Rs 2,979 crore statue are set to observe a bandh in 72 villages and they would not cook in their house that say. In tribal tradition in eastern Gujarat not cooking is construed as mourning.There is also a contrary point of view that the tribals have been given appropriate compensation along with fertile land in the catchment area of the Narmada river and that the protests are politically motivated.Mehta had reportedly accused Gujarat government of violating the Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act of 1996 that empowers only the gram sabhas to approve such projects.At present there are videos in circulation showing police personnel guarding the banners put up for the October 31 ceremony fearing they might be damaged by agitated people.Sources say that Narmada district of which Kevadiya is a part has been turned into a cantonment with the authorities taking no chance of there being an embarrassment to the government. There have been many instances of posters about the event being blackened or torn by the agitators.Sources in Bharuch said that the ceremony and participation of guests have both been curtailed by the government fearing large scale protests.Social activist Rohit Prajapati said, “The government had never imagined that it would face such opposition from the people at the ground level and there would be no people to buy its development narrative. The people have understood that the motive is to privatise everything including their land. The masses can forget violence coming from communal riots but they cannot forget the taking over of their land. Why is the government reluctant to debate on the environmental and social issues?”Even the two-phased ‘Ekta Yatra’ started by Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani to create awareness about Patel’s role in merger of 562 princely states into independent India has drawn a lukewarm response. The government plans to cover 10,000 villages through 60 ‘Ekta Raths’. This has become a matter of concern for the BJP as this yatra was meant to help gauge the public mood ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.There have also been reports about the state government pulling up district collectors for failing to ensure the presence of villagers in the ranks of the ‘Ekta Yatra’ participants and instead filling them up with primary school children.People are also questioning the massive spending on the Kevadiya show on October 31, which brings the total cost of the statue and ceremony to well above the reported cost of around Rs 3,000 crore for building and maintaining the 182-metre statue built on Sadhu island in Narmada river.",Why the Statue of Unity Hasn't Quite Generated the Euphoria BJP Craved,Pre-Construction
"Built on the river island called Sadhu Bet near Vadodara, Statue of Unity is said to be the tallest in the world with a height of 182 metres. The statue was built in the memory of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the Iron Man of India and was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 31, 2018, on the birth anniversary of Patel. As the statue completes a year, here's a look at some amazing facts about it : With a height of 182 metres, the statue is said to be the largest in the world, taller than the Buddha Statue in Spring Temple Budha in China (128 metres), The Statue of Liberty in the US (93 metres) as well as Brazil’s Christ, The Redeemer (38 metres).The statue is approximately 3.5 kms away from the Sardar Sarovar Dam at Kevadia in the Narmada district.The construction of the statue was undertaken by Larsen &Toubro (L&T) with the total project costing around Rs. 2,989 crore.The statue has a hotel enclosed within it. The hotel named ‘Shrestha Bharat Bhavan’, is a 52-key, 3-star facility on two guestroom levels above a public floor containing meal services, a ballroom, and other meeting and event spaces. King rooms and suites are located on the riverside of the building, where they have access to balconies overlooking generous gardens.The project also includes a unique museum and audio-visual department depicting the life and times of Sardar Vallabhbai Patel.The statue also has a laser, light and sound show on the efforts of Unification of India.The statue also has a shopping centre and a selfie point. A viewing gallery at the height of 193 metres from sea level is included in the project, which can accommodate 200 visitors at a time.A heavy-load open lift with a panoramic view is built alongside the Statue of Unity. Visitors can rise up within statue, walk into a viewing gallery and enjoy a panoramic view of the Sardar Sarovar Nigam project and the surrounding region from an astounding height of close to 400ft.",Statue of Unity completes a year: Here are some interesting facts about the project,Post-Construction
"Two elevators take visitors up to the Viewing Gallery housed in the chest of the statue between the 2nd and 3rd buttons of the jacket.Ensconced in nature’s lap, this tallest statue of the world is a sight to behold! One no longer needs to travel to China, Japan, the United States of America, or Russia, to look at statues that feature among the tallest in the world.Standing majestically on the isle of Sadhu-Bet at a height of 182 metres from ground level, the Statue of Unity has left behind many a towering structure across the world.It is an international practice to measure statues from ground level to top. Resting on a rectangular base 25 metre above the ground-level, the Statue measures 157 metres, at least 4 metres taller than the Spring Temple, Buddha, almost twice the height of Statue of Liberty and 5 times higher than Christ’s Statue at Rio de Janeiro!Its height denotes the strength of Gujarat Vidhan Sabha (Legislative Assembly).Architectural excellenceGuided by eminent architect Ram Sutar, it took round-the-clock efforts to construct Sardar Patel’s statue on a base to withstand its 1700 tonnes of weight. The weight of the broadest part comes upon its narrowest part – a difficult adjustment to arrive at.Sample the minute details. The feet are not parallel – one foot is slightly ahead of the other one, denoting a nation marching ahead. The sandals are 70 feet long. Small and big stitches reflect the possibility of human error in preparing hand-made footwear.The Statue will gradually turn bluish-green, due to copper and oxidation process. In fact, the feet have already started turning green!Two elevators take visitors up to the Viewing Gallery housed in the chest of the Statue between the 2nd and 3rd buttons of the jacket. The panoramic view spans across Sardar Sarovar dam, the reservoir, Satpura and Vindhya ranges and River Narmada winding majestically through the Valley.The 4 metres per second speed of these elevators takes visitors to a height of 135 metres in just 36 seconds.Light and Sound ShowThe 23-minute Light and Sound Show at 7 p.m is the show-stopper. Colourful laser beams light up the Statue of Unity. The story unfolds on the Statue, which itself becomes the screen. Jet planes shooting across the statue keep the audience mesmerised. These Jets had flown over the Statue on October 31, 2018. The show aptly concludes with the National Anthem.After dusk, roads, buildings and flora illuminated with neon light clusters make Kevadia look like a land straight out of a fairy-tale!Why KevadiaSeveral illustrious places - Nadiad, Karamsad, Mumbai, or even Bardoli could have fitted the bill. Kevadia and Narmada Valley, however, symbolise Sardar Patel’s vision of modern India. Sardar Patel had mooted the idea of a dam across Narmada in 1946.Among the seven holy rivers, Narmada has ‘Narmada Puran’ and Narmadashtakam dedicated to it. It is one of the two rivers that flows westwards. A dip, or even a sight of Narmada is considered purifying and liberating. ‘Narmada Parikrama’ (circumambulation) is widely considered a lifetime pilgrimage!Locals aver, “Jitne Kankar Utney Shankar” implying that each pebble in Narmada is a living manifestation of Lord Shiva.‘Karmyogi’ VisionEnvisioned by Shri Narendra Modi as Gujarat Chief Minister, the contours of this pan-India vision were shaped much before the 2014 polls. Before 2014, it was unimaginable that the tallest statue in the world could be in India. The towering vision of ‘Karmyogi’ Prime Minister has filled every Indian heart with tonnes of pride.Expanding InfrastructurePhysical infrastructure at Kevadia is being expanded at a rapid pace. Dr. Rajiv Kumar Gupta, Additional Chief Secretary (Forest & Environment Department) and Managing Director, Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited says, “A few more tourist attractions are going to be added, but the priority at present is to expand accommodation facilities and making available more travel options to the tourists. In addition to the 4-lane road from Vadodara and Sea Plane from Ahmedabad, now broad-gauge train option will also be shortly available.”The upscaled infrastructure is generating revenue and enhanced employment opportunities for local people. Already, about 100 local youth have been roped in as guides.Other AttractionsThe statue is not the only tourist hotspot. An entire ecosystem has been developed, apparently rooted in the ancient Indian concept of Purush and Prakriti – maintaining a harmonious balance between man and nature. Other attractions include Aarogya Van, Jungle Safari, river rafting, cactus garden and Children’s Nutrition Garden.FootnoteThe statue is a manifestation of Ek Bharat, Shreshth Bharat.

"The Statue of Unity in Gujarat has been in the news ever since its inauguration, be it for a good reason or not-so-good. It has managed to draw attention of many curious tourists till date due to immense promotions done by Gujarat Tourism. Yet, the majority of urban population is not happy with the state government’s effort to spend INR 300 crore to build such a massive statue.Apparently, the Statue of Unity is in the news again and for the wrong reason. On Saturday morning, the statue was found flooded by rainwater after the city experienced heavy downpour recently. However, the government officials claimed on Twitter that the statue has been “designed” in a certain way for tourists to enable better viewing. On their part, however, the tourists who visited the site on Saturday were very upset with the leakage and stagnant rainwater that had gathered in the gallery.The official also stated that the rainwater has been blown out by high-velocity winds into the gallery area. They assured the public that the issue of water accumulation is being taken care of by the maintenance team.The gallery of Statue of Unity features a grill sort of structure due to which the rainwater easily seeps in. It’s roof was leaking, and this really disappointed the visitors.Apparently, social media users who were at the water accumulation site blamed the government for failing to make the statue water-proof even after spending the moolah.The Statue of Unity is a giant-sized image of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel who was a reformer and independence activist during the Gandhian era. The statue was made primarily to boost tourism in Gujarat. ","Rains mar the glory of Statue of Unity in Gujarat, leaving visitors disappointed",Post-Construction
"The statue of unity, one of the most beautiful crafted marvelous sculptures, is existing in this modern era in loving memory of Bismarck and architect of modern India Sardar Vallabhai Patel. The great initiative taken by the central government to build this colossal effigy has been under various allegations of wastage of money by the agitated farmers all over the country, but the same has also been much emphasized and appreciated by the intellectualists and philosophers—our Hon. Prime minister Mr. Narendra Modi in his speech, quoted, ‘’It will be a reminder about the courage of a man who thwarted efforts to disintegrate India’’ says all about this project.The project above is a great success and will prove as an asset to this nation in the future. It is economically and technically viable, with high earning potential. I must say it’s a farsighted approach from our prime minister and his team. The statue is in an isolated area; hence, creating such an alluring atmosphere of the figure and the birds-eye view was a difficult and challenging mission. This project in the Kevadiya district proved a lifeline for the dwellers employing 85 % of the local population. It has undoubtedly raised the standard of living in the neighborhood. It has always been a constant source of income for the low-income community, residing in nearby areas and regions.The tourist industry will have a significant impact as the statue is expected to develop as a hot tourist spot gradually and generated rupees 6.87 crores ticket revenue in the very first month of opening. The figure is expected to attract 75 million per year by 2020, Thus generating an income of over 20 thousand million. Not only financial benefits, but it has also led to public welfare. It is built at a time when the whole nation was going through religional disturbances on the grounds of caste, financial conditions. There was a great need to synchronize all our people to regain stability in India again; at this time, the run for unity, i.e., a statue of our great leader, was a massive and successful move by the Hon. Prime Minister to influence the countrymen to walk on the footsteps of Sardar Vallabhai Patel that refers to uniting again. Further, the statue is now seen as a trademark for unity, and it changed the undeveloped kevadiya into a well-developed city with all the amenities, facilities like boat riding, bird view, etc. Despite several protests and disturbed tribal, the project was a humongous success. I have not seen a memorial or a public place with such an extraordinary response within its first month. It will surely expand the tourism industry, have a positive impact on not just only on GDP but also on GNP. It’s a medium by which the government and the citizens will get the best of both worlds.

"Police have registered a case against some employees of a cash collection agency for allegedly siphoning off ₹5.24 crore generated from the sale of tickets of the Statue of Unity in Gujarat’s Narmada district, a police official said on December 2.The imposing monument of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, also called the Statue of Unity, is a major tourist attraction in the State since it was inaugurated in October 2018.The money collected over one-and-a-half years by the Statue of Unity management at Kevadia in Narmada district was handed over to the cash collection agency, hired by a private bank in Vadodara, the official said.Some staffers of the agency allegedly did not deposit ₹5,24,77,375 into the bank accounts of the Statue of Unity authorities, Deputy Superintendent of Police Vani Dudhat said.“The private bank’s manager lodged an FIR at Kevadia police station on Monday night against unidentified persons working with the cash collection agency,” she said.“A case was registered under Indian Penal Code Sections 420 [cheating], 406 [criminal breach of trust] and 120-B [criminal conspiracy],” she said, adding that no one has been arrested so far.Meanwhile, the Statue of Unity’s authorities on December 2 said the bank has deposited ₹5.24 crore into their accounts.“The Statue of Unity management is not involved in this issue. It is between the bank and its cash collection agency. The bank has already deposited the amount into our accounts,” a senior official of the management said.As per the FIR, the bank has been taking services of the agency since 2003 for cash collection and deposition.The bank had appointed the same agency to collect cash generated from the sale of tickets at the Statue of Unity and other connected tourist attractions and deposit it into the two bank accounts of the State of Unity authorities, the police official said.“In a recent audit, the State of Unity officials found a mismatch in the amount mentioned in cash deposit slips, given by the agency staff after collecting the cash, and the actual cash deposited into the bank accounts beween November 2018 and March 2020,” she said.A detailed probe revealed that the agency staff allegedly did not deposit ₹5.24 crore, following which the bank authorities lodged the FIR, she said.“We need to check several records of the agency to find out who were involved in the cash collection exercise at Kevadia,” the official said, adding that no one has been identified or arrested yet.",viral: 2008 bronze statue of Sardar Patel by Gujarati sculptor circulated as Statue of Unity,Pre-Construction
"Country pays tribute to the Iron Man of India with a statue that also showcases its engineering and artistic talentStanding at 182 feet, which is twice the height of the Statue of Liberty in the United States, the Statue of Unity in Gujarat rises on the western shore of India as the pride of the nation. Built on a budget of Rs. 2,989 crore, it is a tribute to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, freedom fighter and India’s first deputy prime minister. Patel, who is popularly known as the Iron Man of India, was responsible for unifying the country post partition in 1947. The world’s tallest statue with bronze cladding is not just a fitting tribute to the country’s Independence hero but also its modern engineering prowess.Constructed by Larsen and Toubro (L&T), the Statue of Unity is located on Sadhu Hill on the banks of the Narmada in Gujarat. The statue towers over another engineering marvel, the Sardar Sarovar Dam, and has already become a draw for tourists from across the country.The project was the winner of PMI India’s Project of the Year in the large category in 2019.Unique challengesWhen L&T took over the project, the team knew one of the biggest challenges would be to bring out the finer details – the facial expressions, folds in the garment, orientation, and posture. But these were important facets for the sake of authenticity and accuracy.It meant a fusion of art and engineering on an unprecedented scale. It required engagement with non-conventional agencies, like sculptors and historians, and going through huge archives of Patel’s photographs before zeroing in on the look.The final posture of the statue, in which one leg is ahead of the other mimicking a walking stance, also posed significant challenge. It meant that the statue couldn’t have one strong, wide base, which is the norm in tall statues for protection against wind speed. After several rounds of discussions, the design engineers opted for two giant columns to pass through both the legs of the statue to make it stable, without compromising on the aesthetic aspect.“Our engineering and construction team, along with the architects, the sculptor, and a reputable global consultant have converted our honourable prime minister’s dream into reality in record time. Our commitment to the scale, speed, and quality of our engineering has yielded a desirable outcome, which is not only structurally superior but aesthetically appealing as well,” says S.N. Subrahmanyan, CEO and managing director, L&T.Since it was a highly publicized project of national significance, the teams had to work closely with the government authorities on design approvals. Verification of design documents resulted in an increase in approval time from the contractual 21 days to 45 days. This adversely affected the project schedule and required the engineering contractor to deploy additional resources to mitigate the delays.L&T also battled high attrition of workers at the beginning of the project. This was due to the remote location of the project site in a tribal area that lacks good infrastructure and amenities.Some of the key engineering challenges L&T faced were:• Working within the river bed on a hilltop• Environmental clearance to protect the aqua tic and wildlife population in the area• The statue’s stance and orientation• Building a high speed lift and emergency stairs inside the legs of the statue• Maintaining the strength and stability without compromising on the aestheticsThe other key challenges were:• Coordination among man y teams and vendors with different objectives• Procuring material at a location with poor access and mobile connectivity• Creating a conducive work environment with basic amenities• Emotional attachment and expectations of the people• Managing hostilities from local residentsUse of design innovation, cutting-edge technologyDesign innovation, advanced technology, and lateral thinking were applied at every stage as the prestigious project had no room for error or delays. The statue required 6,500 bronze panels of different sizes, shapes, and textures to be assembled. Bronze of minimum thickness was used in the panels to keep the total weight in check.With the help of radio frequency identification (RFID) technology, the team tagged each bronze panel with details such as casting date, inspection status, and its location, and fed that data into a master database. This will enable engineers to easily retrieve data on each panel at any time with the help of an RFID detector gun and an android phone.Two 200-tonne tuned mass dampers, which are devices used to reduce the impact of vibrations during an earthquake, were installed. That makes the statue earthquake resistant. L&T has used special concrete to strengthen the core of the statue comprising the two legs. Indigenous technology was used to generate self-compacting cold concrete which measured less than 15 degree Celsius. This was accomplished using chilled water and ice flakes. This concrete was then poured at a high speed, which was faster than that used during the construction of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.The statue has an outer acrylic-based weather resistant protective coating which will last 100 years.There was a great deal of pressure on the project managers to not just build the statue in record time, but to also accommodate later additions, such as exhibits for the exhibition hall and projection mapping facilities for a light and sound show, including developing the content for it. L&T imported equipment and worked closely with the government authorities and assigned specialists to meet these requirements. Some of the best practices applied were:• Building Information Modeling to prepare 4D reports for creative monitoring/approvals• CCTV cameras, drones, and time-la pse photography for overall view of the project site• Mobile android application like L&T’s Pro-Cube for progress monitoring• Digital software for project documentation• WhatsApp for daily progress monitoring and follow-ups with the site team• Barcoding of drawings that allows users to see 3D images of the drawings on their mobile phones Toward the finish line Due to the sheer grit of the project team and sophisticated engineering and project management skills, the target of constructing the statue, memorial center, service building, and a 5-km-long, 4-lane approach road with one major and two minor bridges, was completed within 33 months and finished on budget. The whole process was based on the ISO 9001-2015 framework of risk assessment and mitigation. The project management team fixed responsibility and accountability at the individual, group, and project levels for smooth delivery of the project.For effective project planning, L&T conducted a workshop in which it analyzed sequential and parallel activities from the point of view of time and resource optimization. The project management team worked like a federal structure where different teams worked independently with their fixed areas of responsibility, but each worked toward a common goal. In this work structure, the project management team closely monitored the intersecting activities of the different teams, but left the micro management of each activity to the department in-charge. Since time was of the essence, the team looked for incremental innovation in design and engineering at every stage to reduce time. The project gave employment to over 8,000 people, including over 2,000 local residents during the duration of the project construction. The Statue of Unity has attracted over 1.5 million tourists since its inauguration on 31 October 2018. It has boosted the local economy by providing direct and indirect employment to local people. “It is a tremendous achievement by our building and factories business vertical. Right from the concept through the entire process of developing the design, the features and characteristics of the statue, the engineering, project planning, logistic, and cost controls, were all managed extremely efficiently and reflected a triumph of teamwork. We are proud to have built a monument that makes the country proud,” says M.V.

"About Statue of Unity Facts:Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s statue or known as the Statue of Unity is situated in the Indian state of Gujarat. Sardar Vallabhai Patel (1875–1950), who was the first Home Minister of India. After completion of the construction work, his statue is the world’s tallest statue standing at a height of 182 meters. The project was first announced in 2010 and the construction of the statue began in October 2013 by Larsen & Toubro, who received the contract for Rs 2,989 crore from the Govt of Gujarat. The sculptor was designed by Indian sculptor Ram V. Sutar. To support the construction of the statue, the Statue of Unity movement was started to support the construction of the statue. This movement helped a lot to collect the iron needed for the statue. By asking farmers to donate their scrap farming instruments. It is heard that by 2016, a total of 135 metric tonnes of scrap iron had been gathered. Out of 135 metric tonnes, about 109 metric tonnes of it were utilized to make the foundation of the statue after processing.The statue is located at the shore of the Narmada River facing the Sardar Sarovar Dam. The statue was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 31, 2018, on the 143rd birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.On 15th December 2013, a marathon entitled “Run For Unity” was held in Surat and in Vadodara to support the project.The world’s tallest “Statue of Unity” is a pride of India and a decent honor to the fearless who undivided and integrated India, our precious Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. He was highly respected for his leadership in uniting the 552 states of India to form the single Union of India.About Design:After studying several statues of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel across the country, a team of historians, artists, and academics choose to proceed with a design submitted by the Indian sculptor, Ram V. Sutar. The expression, posture and pose justify the dignity, confidence, iron will, and kindness that his personality expel. Three models of the design measuring 3 feet, 18 feet, and 30 feet were created at the beginning. Once the design of the largest model was approved, a detailed 3D-scan was designed which model the basis for the bronze cladding cast in a workshop in China.About Construction: India’s leading infrastructure company L&T won the contract on 27 October 2014 for its lowest bid of Rs 2,989 crore equivalent to Rs 36 billion in 2018 for the design, construction, and maintenance. They initiated the construction on 31 October 2014. In phase-1 of the project, Rs 1,347 crore was spent for the main statue, Rs 235 crore spent for the exhibition hall and convention center, Rs 83 crore spent for the bridge connecting the memorial to the mainland and Rs 657 crore spent for the maintenance of the structure for 15 years after its completion. As per the L&T official, they have employed over 3000 workers and 250 engineers for the construction of the statue. The foundation of the statue utilized 210,000 cubic meters of cement concrete, 6500 tonnes of structural steel, and 18500 tonnes of thickened steel. The outer part together with 1700 tonnes of bronze plates and 1850 tonnes of bronze surrounding which in turn include 565 macro and 6000 micro panels. The total height of the structure is 240 m (790 ft), with a base of 58 m (190 ft) and the statue of 182 m (597 ft). The height of 182 was specially chosen to match the number of seats in the Gujarat Legislative Assembly. The statue is built in a way that can stand up against winds of up to 180 km/hour and earthquakes measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale which is at a depth of 10 km and within a radius of 12 km of the statue. It took 57 months to complete, 15 months for planning, 40 months for construction and two months for handing over by the consortium. To make sure seamless execution of the whole project, an independent society named Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust (SVPRET) has been established under the Chairmanship of Chief Minister, Government of Gujarat.About Funding:The total cost of the project was estimated to be about Rs 2,063 crore equivalent to Rs 25 billion in 2018 by the government. The tender bids for phase-1 were invited in October 2013 and were closed in November 2013. This statue was built by the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model. Most of the money allocated by Gujarat Govt i.e. Rs 500 crore for the project in the budget from 2012-2015. Rs 239 crore was also allocated in the 2014-15 Union Budget for the construction of the statue. Funds were also shared by the Public Sector Undertakings under the Corporate Social Responsibility scheme.Issues faced during the construction:Local tribals belonging to the Tadvi caste against land acquisition for the construction of tourism infrastructure nearby the statue. Although, they have been offered cash, land compensation, and provided jobs. People of nearby villages such as Kevadia, Kothi, Waghodia, Limbdi, Navagam, and Gora against the construction of the statue and claimed the refund of the land rights over 375 hectares (927 acres) of land obtained earlier for the construction of the dam as well as the constitution of new Garudeshwar subdistrict. They also disagree with the development of the Kevadia Area Development Authority (KADA) and the construction of the Garudeshwar weir-cum-causeway project. At last, the government of Gujarat has to accept their demands.About Tourism: The Gujarat government has made every effort to develop the entire neighborhood as a world-class tourist center. As it is double in height of world-famous New York’s Statue of Liberty. The Statue of Unity is fair to draw numbers of foreign tourists along with domestic visitors across India. The statue’s location is its important features. The beautiful scenic surroundings of the Satpura and Vindhyachal hills along with the heroic river Narmada give the perfect view to the statue, which is built on an Island. The viewers’ gallery inside the statue is a prime attraction at the site located at the height of 135 with a capacity to accommodate 200 persons at a time. There are also high-speed lifts installed and are capable of taking 5,000 people per day to the viewing gallery, which offers a breathtaking sight of the surrounding areas. There are numerous other tourist attractions around apart from the Statue of Unity including the valley of flowers, natural beauty of the Satpura and Vindhyachal hill ranges. The Gujarat government newly opened a luxurious nature sanctuary, Tent City Narmada, just 10 minutes away from the monument. On 1st November 2018, over 1,28,000 tourists visited the Statue of Unity in 11 days after it was opened to the public. At the same time, over 1.9 million visitors in 9 months were visited. It is expected that this tallest statue will generate around 15,000 direct jobs in tourism.Proposed and Planned Infra:As of now, there are several projects in the card to assure that this place turns out to be a popular tourist point. A world-class zoo will be developed across 1,300 acres over seven levels by the name Sardar Patel Zoological Park near the statue. Moreover, there is a plan to start boating activities near the statue as a jetty is being constructed in the Narmada.Recent News on Statue of Unity:The day before yesterday, PM Modi urges people to visit Sardar Sarovar Dam and its nearby the Statue Of Unity in his home state Gujarat that has touched historic 134-meter water levels. After setting a number of records, the Statue of Unity in Gujarat has found a place in the Time’s list of 100 greatest places in the world. It is a matter of pride that the Statue of Unity is emerging as a popular tourist destination and at the same time, a record 34,000 people visited the site in a single day.On 18th August 2019, Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani inaugurated a river rafting sports facility at Khalvani near the Statue of Unity.This statue is known as the Pride of the Nation, but the mass of people think that spending Rs. 2900 crores on it have been completely wastage of public money. Several questions have been asked In the recent govt exams.What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Statue of Unity?Advantages of Statue of UnityIt is the world’s tallest statue which has recently been awarded in Time’s list of 100 greatest places in the world, is located in India and considered to be ‘Pride of Nation’.It will boost income from tourism and generate a large number of hotels, transports and other services.Increase in the transport, restaurants, accommodation, service sectors.It is estimated that this statue will remain as it is for 1000 years which implies that it will contribute to the national income of India through tourism for centuries.Local people getting employment.The local business has seen lots of progress.Disadvantages of Statue of UnityThe government has spent a huge amount of money on this project over other priorities like women’s safety, education and agriculture schemes.There are plenty of sectors in India, like health, safety, employment and education where the money could have been utilized.Many political parties allege that this was a place of religious significance, so it should not be built on the land.Was it worth spending a huge amount on the Statue of Unity?If I start writing whether the Statue of Unity worth or not, it will go on and on but I hope this little and fair idea of why building this statue is a step in the right direction. It will lead to a lot of new employment opportunities every year and PM Modi has promised that thousands of young generation will get employment through this project. It’s not just about Inda’s pride of building the tallest statue but it’s about creating employment and revenue for the country. At the same time, it will create new business opportunities for the people living in nearby areas. Local businesses have been seen in lots of progress. Earlier nearer restaurants used to remain profitable only during monsoon while dam overflowing. Increase in the transport, restaurants, accommodation, and service sectors. This reversely will improve the economy of India. Living in a developing country we always aim to think of everything from the perspective of giving everything to poor people, but that does not help after 76 years of Independence. As per a report, 480 million people are still under poverty like in India. If the government just donated these Rs 2989 cr in their bank accounts, they would have got peanuts. That’s not a decent amount to give them. Also, when was the last time giving free money helped the poor get out of poverty? Employing more n more people will simply take out people from poverty. This is just one project. The government has lots of projects in place to help the poor offering education, medical facilities, toilets, and housing facilities. How is it fair to say that projects like these should not be undertaken and instead the money should again be used for education and other purposes? If we do that, we will never come out of that wrong period.For the development of the nation, we need to change our mindset and start thinking of initiatives like these from a different angle not from the angle of politics.",Disadvantages of the Statue of Unity,Post-Construction
"In Kevadia, the mighty Narmada flows between the Satpura and Vindhayachal, slyly giving way to a smooth four-lane highway that leads to two remarkable structures: the Statue of Unity and the Sardar Sarovar Dam. Twice, it seems, the country has looked at Kevadia and both times in scale, the result has been quite remarkable. Driving up the highway, one can certainly rejoice in the fact that the Statue of Unity is far removed from the bustle of the cities. After all, the charm of concrete skylines would fade rather quickly. Erecting the statue in a nondescript town not only puts it on the tourist map but also creates a playground of opportunities, one that the state government has been efficient to act upon. However shrouded in controversy it may be, our first glance at the Statue of Unity was enough to make us gasp quite audibly. There was nothing quite like it. The sheer size of it seemed unfathomable, my whole self as tall as Sardar Patel’s tiniest toe. Photo Credit: Puneet K. PaliwalFoot and sandal of the statue Standing on the river island of Sadhu Bet, the Statue of Unity is built to last a hundred years, braving earthquakes and other natural disasters. Made up of different metals, the iron in the statue was crowdsourced under the Loha campaign, collecting scraps from every state in the country. The outer façade in bronze, will slowly turn to a dull teal, similar to the Statue of Liberty in New York. As we rode the many travelators, escalators and elevators to the viewing gallery at 135 metres above ground, our guide was quick to churn out facts, and quicker in pointing out the many selfie points. For instance, the viewing gallery is located where the statue’s heart would be. That the statue stands at a height of 182 metres, also the number of constituencies in Gujarat. That it faces the Sardar Sarovar Dam, Patel’s lifelong dream. Or that, the sculptor, Padma Bhushan Ram V Sutar, has incorporated deliberate imperfections into the statue to reflect Sardar’s personality, like the stitches on his sandals, all different in size. From the viewing gallery, we could not only look at the view outside, but also another window that allowed us take a peak at the inside of the structure. At night, we made our way to the Statue of Unity again. I had heard nothing about a light and sound show and was taken aback by how spectacular it truly was. Lit up in a plethora of colours and effects, a gripping narrative wove the life of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, his contribution to the newly independent India, and finally, the conception and construction of the statue. If nothing, the noise from the audience was enough to speak of its success. Since it opened in October 2018, the Statue of Unity has pulled crowds like no other. Officials estimate that the statue witnesses a footfall of 7,000 visitors a day, going up to 20,000 during the holiday season. If managing the number of visitors was a challenge, another was to hold them in Kevadia long enough to invest in it. The birth of the Statue of Unity circuit has been handled with an iron will. Photo Credit: Puneet K. PaliwalThe Statue of Unity in the evening Within months, more than 20 different attractions have cropped up, to enthrall visitors for atleast two to three days. There is scope as there is variety; from the statue, one can take a bus (no private vehicles are allowed inside) to the many gardens in the vicinity. We started at the Valley of Flowers, spread across 600 acres with more than two million plants, and then later to Butterfly Garden, Cactus Garden and Arogya Van; each prettier than the last. At Arogya Van, the three-dimensional layout of the Aushadh Manav made for an interesting sight. An installation and a trail wrapped in one, we walked through the many organs, arteries and veins, each bit growing ayurvedic plants beneficial to that particular part of the human body. If there were gardens for some to enjoy, others would be surprised to find the adventure that lies in Kevadia— hiking, zip-lining and camping among many others. We were pulled in for river rafting the next day, going through the narrow rivulet and excitedly tackling grade four rapids; the experience of it, akin to the one in Rishikesh. Our last hour in Kevadia was spent boating, with crocodiles bobbing up and down, some more camera-shy than the others. We heard that nearby villages will soon open their doors for local walks and homestays. Photo Credit: Puneet K. PaliwalEntrance of a village home The newly-launched mall, open-air zoo and the Children Nutrition Park would keep the young ones occupied. There are also talks of an auditorium, a mirror maze, and a digital forest world. Who knows, maybe in the future, Kevadia will draw more tourists than all other attractions in the country combined. INFORMATION GETTING THERE Kevadia is well-connected to Vadodara, Ahmedabad and Surat. Vadodara is a two-hour drive from Kevadia, with Air India and Indigo offering flights from most major cities in India. No private vehicles are allowed after a point, but buses at half-hour intervals are available at every attraction.

"It is a matter of pride for India that such a gigantic statue of Indian politician Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has been built in the country, that too, in just 33 months. It cost 2,989-crore (about Dh1.47 billion, or $402 million). The 182 meter sculpture and structure made out of 100,000 tons of steel, concrete and bronze is indicative of what can India do. All other tall statues in the world have been dwarfed by this one. The statue has been named as the ‘Statue of Unity’ and is taller than the famous Statue of Liberty, in the US. It is a tribute to Patel who amalgamated around 560 states of Rajas and Maharajas into one single nation, India, in the year 1947. - Aftab Ahmad The statue has been named as the ‘Statue of Unity’ and is taller than the famous Statue of Liberty, in the US.

Photographs make life permanent Image Credit: Stock images Photography apturing life for eternity By Avanthika Balaji As I walk, the field of vision before me alters from moment to moment. My eyes vigilantly scrutinise my surroundings. When I feel like I have received some sort of sign from nature, my fingers automatically go for the shot. Photography is both striking and yet subtle in the way in which it deals with its subjects. It takes an instant out of time, alters life by holding it still and permanent. What I love most about photography is that you manage to capture a moment with a camera, without having anticipated it. You have to be ready to welcome the unexpected. A perfect snapshot freezes the moment before it has slipped away. It has little to do with the things you see and everything to do with the way you perceive what your eyes notice through the lens There are many reasons why I’m passionate about photography...I was in search of a tool that would help me engaging with the world every day. Photographs are the universal language of our era. - Avanthika Balaji There are many reasons why I’m passionate about photography. I was in search of a tool that would help me engaging with the world every day. Photographs are the universal language of our era. To take a good shot, all that you require is the perfect light, background and a little creativity. Photographs try to tell a story. It could be about happiness, misery, joy, triumphs and any kind of emotion. A photograph, to me, is an open door into the past and another that allows a closer look into the present. It is indeed an art of observation. I do not know any subject that is more complex or richer than architectural photography that is all about capturing concrete structures rising vertically from the ground, and posing a frontal outlook in the line of vision. ",People are unhappy with the tallest Indian statue of Sardar Patel and its cost,Post-Construction
"In just a few short months, the river island called Sandhu Bet in the Indian state of Gujarat will boast the world’s tallest statue that is expected to be twice as high as the Statue of Liberty and nearly five times as high as Christ the Redeemer in Rio. Dubbed the ‘Statue of Unity’, the controversial monument will cost a staggering US$460 million.Using public funds and private donations, construction began in October 2014. It is said that upon its completion, this colossal monument will change India‘s identity to the world, as it will not just be a tourist attraction, but a glorious vision, a source of inspiration and a symbol of unity. This architectural and historical marvel, connecting India’s past with her present and future, is a tribute to the beloved Iron Man of India.Statue of Unity is twice the height of Statue of Liberty and five times taller than Christ the Redeemer in Rio | © Statue of Unity / YouTubeWho is the ‘Iron Man of India’?This steel and bronze statue is a depiction of the Indian Independence Movement leader Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, commonly referred to as the Iron Man of India. Considered one of the greatest leaders of the country, Sardar Patel is credited for playing a key role in India’s freedom struggle and the unification of the nation. His strong ideology, pragmatic approach and utter devotion led to the creation of an independent India full of potential. He was posthumously awarded the Bharat Ratna (the highest civilian award in India) in 1991.What will the worlds’s tallest statue look like?A dream project of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the foundation stone was laid on October 31, 2013, which was the 138th birth anniversary of Sardar Patel. Spread over 20,000 acres of land, the statue is erected on a tiny rocky island around 1.8 miles from Sardar Sarovar Dam in the lap of the Narmada riverbed. The base on which the statue stands has three levels that contain an audio-visual gallery, a memorial garden and a museum/exhibition hall showcasing the life, contributions and achievements of Sardar Patel.Book the travel you've missedAt a height of 152.4 metres from the riverbed, there will be an observation deck that will be able to accommodate 200 people at a time. This large decked area will enable visitors to get a 360-degree panoramic views of the Vindhyachal and Satpura mountain ranges, the 132-mile long Sardar Sarovar Dam, and the 7.4-mile long Garudeshwar Reservoir. Additionally, an open lift also boasting stunning vistas will be constructed alongside the monument. Visitors will be able to go all the way up to the statue’s head and enjoy a bird’s eye view of the surrounding landscape.For an outstanding experience, a sprawling complex of buildings will be constructed, which will be connected to the monument via a long pedestrian bridge. The complex will include a visitor and conservation centre, a memorial, a 3-star hotel, an underwater aquarium, research centres and institutes, recreational spots and restaurants. The statue and its surrounding attractions will be accessible via boat.It is believed that, as a symbolic contribution, the iron used in constructing the Statue of Unity and other structures around it has been sourced from farmers from 700,000 villages across the country. The monument is already 157 metres high and, once complete, it is expected to reach 182 metres (without the pedestal), making it undoubtedly the tallest statue in the world.The credit for the monument’s design goes to well-known Indian sculptor Ram V Sutar. Furthermore, the entire project is being supervised by a consortium of Michael Graves & Associates, Meinhardt Group, and Turner Construction.Brewing controversyEven before the world’s tallest statue has seen the light of day, it has already attracted controversy. Since the commencement of its construction, the project has been facing stiff opposition from locals and environmentalists. Many locals are against the use of land around the monument for tourism infrastructure, as it is the site of religious importance. On the other hand, environmentalists claim that the project will affect the environment and ecology of the area.And let’s not forget the staggering amount of expenditure incurred in building the project – it’s going to cost a whopping INR2,989 crore (US$460 million) in public funds!The generous use of public funds – which could have been utilised for the welfare of the people – has sparked fierce debates and opposition across the country. Mohan Gurumurthy, from the Centre for Policy Alternatives, told the Telegraph in 2013 that “even Sardar Patel himself would have objected to money being spent in this way”.Yet, despite the protests and outrageous operational and construction costs involved, ruling party BJP is determined to pay tribute to the freedom fighter in this manner.“Sardar Patel brought the nation together. But gradually his memories are fading away. To reinvigorate his memory and as a fitting tribute to the Iron Man of India, we are building this statue,” PM Modi said at a rally addressing Indian farmers.An initiative to boost tourismIt is believed that this mega project will firmly put the state on the tourist map. During a rally in Dabhoi in 2017 , Prime Minister Modi said, “Lakhs of foreign tourists visit Taj Mahal in Agra every year, but I feel that they will be forced to visit the Statue of Unity once it is completed. We were presenting Taj Mahal to foreign tourists, but this statue will also become another architecture marvel.”However, as mentioned above, not everyone agrees with the prime minister. Mixed reactions are pouring in from people across the country. Some critics have called the project the ‘worst idea’ and ‘an absolute waste of money’, while others are upbeat about its future, as it will bring great revenue from tourism in the area.The great unveilingThe statue is expected to be inaugurated on October 31, 2018, the 143rd birth anniversary of Sardar Patel. When it opens later this year, it will officially replace the Spring Temple Buddha in Henan, China, as the world’s tallest statue. ","This Country is Building the World's Tallest Statue, Here's Why",Pre-Construction

ADVERTISINGTheapex auditor questioned the decision of PSUs to allocate part of theircorporate social responsibility (CSR) funds for construction of theworld's tallest statue.Ad campaign for the statue ""Statue ofUnity - Loha Campaign - Kahani Har Gaon Ki"" had positioned it as beingbuilt out of people's contribution. The ad shows used farm equipmentbeing collected from each village to contribute to building the statueof the Iron Man of India. ""...the Loha Campaign facilitated the donationof used farm tools (one from each village across the country) fromfarmers as a form of tribute to the tallest leader of modern India whohimself was born in a farmer's family, and led several farmerrevolutions during India's struggle for independence. So far, around1,69, 000 loha kits have been collected,"" says the website of the Statueof Unity.In a report tabled in the Parliament on August 7, 2018,the government auditor said that contribution to 'Sardar VallabhbhaiPatel Rashtriya Ekta Trust (SVPRET)' for Gujarat government's ""Statue ofUnity"" project cannot pass off as a contribution towards a projectaimed at protecting national heritage, art and culture (an approved CSRactivity as per schedule VII of the Companies Act 2013) as it was not aheritage asset.CPSEsOil & Natural Gas Corporation, Hindustan Petroleum CorporationLimited, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited, Indian Oil CorporationLimited and Oil India Limited had together contributed Rs 146.83 crore(ONGC Rs 50 crore, IOCL Rs 21.83 crore, BPCL, HPCL, OIL Rs 25 croreeach) in 2016-17.ONGC justified the contribution by stating thatthe project included activities such as promotion of education anddevelopment of banks of River Narmada. The Management of BPCL, HPCL andIOCL stated in their reply to CAG that as per Circular No. 21/2014issued by MCA they interpreted the activity liberally to capture theessence of the subjects enumerated in the Schedule VII of Companies Act2013. CAG observed the entire amount of Rs 50 crore has been given toSVPRET as contribution towards corpus of the Trust. ""Theexpenditure would be incurred by the Trust. SVPRET sought the help ofCPSEs after there was a shortfall of Rs 780 crore. The work, awarded toLarsen & Toubro Ltd in October 2014 has a completion deadline ofOctober 2018. The fact remains that the contribution towardsconstruction of Statue does not qualify as CSR activity as per scheduleVII of the Companies Act, 2013"", CAG maintained.The Rs 2989 croreproject comprises the 182 meter high bronze plated statue of SardarPatel, a memorial and visitor's centre, gardens and a convention centrenamed 'Shresth Bharat Bhawan'. The initial cost of the projectwas estimated at Rs 2,063 crore.

"The Statue of Unity is an iconic 182 meters tall tribute to one of India’s foremost Statesmen and leaders – Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. The statue is neither meant for merely taking pride in its magnitude nor will it stand like a silent memorial. Rather a special work plan has been designed to make this statue a vibrant working centre. The ‘Statue of Unity’ is being built not only to remember India’s freedom struggle but also to inculcate Sardar Patels’s visionary ideology of unity, patriotism, inclusive growth and good governance.Prime Minister Narendra Modi dedicated to the nation Statue of Unity, built in honour of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel at Kevadiya in Narmada district of Gujarat 01 November 2018. Unveiling the 182-meter statue of the Iron Man of India, world's tallest, on his 143rd birth anniversary, Prime Minister said Sardar Patel's statue will remind the world about the courage of the man who thwarted attempts to disintegrate India.He said had Sardar Patel not united the country, we would need the visa to see lions or pay homage at Somnath or view Charminar in Hyderabad. He said Sardar Patel's statue will remind those who question India's existence that this nation was, is and will remain eternal. Modi described the Statue of Unity as a symbol of the country's engineering and technical capabilities. Gujarat Governor O P Kohli, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani and BJP chief Amit Shah were present at the unveiling of the 'Statue of Unity'.Modi said his government was toiling in line with Patel’s dreams to create a “strong, alert and inclusive India”. Referring to criticism over construction of the project, Modi said the BJP is censured even when it praises great leaders like Patel. “Is it (praising great leaders) a crime?” Modi asked the gathering present at the unveiling ceremony. “It was the sentiment of crores of Indians that the man who united the country should get the honour he deserved,” the prime minister said. It was the responsibility of the people to give a befitting reply to efforts “aimed at dividing the country”, he said.“The world’s tallest statue will remind the entire world, the future generations about the courage, capabilities and resolution of the person who did the holy work of thwarting the conspiracy to disintegrate Mother India into pieces,” Modi said. Had Patel not united the country, people would need a visa to see lions in the Gir Forest National Park, pay homage at Somnath or view the Charminar in Hyderabad, the prime minister said.The imposing monument is twice the height of the Statue of Liberty in the US and is built on an islet, Sadhu Bet, near the Sardar Sarovar Dam in Gujarat's Narmada district. A viewing gallery has been created at a height of 135 meters inside the statue to enable tourists to have a view of the dam and nearby mountain ranges. Near the statue, Modi also unveiled the ‘Wall of Unity’ which has been created with the earth samples collected from various states across the country. As part of the effort to make the region around the statue a tourist spot, many projects like Valley of Flowers and Tent City have been developed.The work of 182-meter tall statue has been completed after round the clock work by 3,400 labourers and 250 engineers at Sadhu Bet island on Narmada River in Gujarat. Briefing media persons in Gandhinagar, Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel has said that state government is planning to celebrate this historic event on a big scale. He said that Sardar Sarovar Dam on Narmada river which is the lifeline of Gujarat was a dream of Sardar Patel and the work of this dam has also been completed recently. AIR Ahmedabad correspondent reports from the site of the Statue of Unity project that Chief Minister Vijay Rupani today reviewed the ongoing work and preparations of its unveiling function.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had laid the foundation stone of this project on 31 October 2013 when he was the chief minister of Gujarat. The world's tallest - the Statue of Unity- has been built at the cost of about Rs.2400 crore. The core of the statue is made up of reinforced concrete while the surface has been created by using 553 bronze panels.Standing at 3 kilometers downstream of the Narmada dam on Sadhu bet island, the statue has a viewing gallery at the height of 193 meters from sea level which can accommodate 200 visitors at a time. The museum on the life of Sardar Patel is at the base, and two high-speed lifts will take people to the viewers' gallery. According to sources, around 15,000 tourists are expected to visit the statue on daily basis. The Statue of Unity has been built using over 70,000 tonnes of cement, 18,500 tonnes of reinforcement steel, 6,000 tonnes of structural steel and 1,700 metric tonnes of bronze, which was used for the outer cladding of the structure.The ‘Statue of Unity’ is a dream project of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It symbolizes Patel’s impeccable work of uniting the disintegrated groups of nearly 565 princely states after the independence and building the Indian State. It stands as a tribute to the extraordinary administrative skills and bravery shown by the then home minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in uniting India after the bloody and painful partition. The Sardar’s 182 meters high first of its kind statue will undoubtedly lead to development of tourism with tourists inflow from all across the globe to visit India to admire its beauty and salute the man behind the Indian spirit and unity.The work order for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's pet project 'Statue of Unity' the world's tallest statue of India's first home minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, has been issued by the Gujarat government to leading engineering company Larsen and Toubro (L&T). Work on the 182-metre tall statue of Sardar Patel is to be completed at a cost of Rs 2,979 crore, which is far more than the total sum of Rs 700 crores allocated so far. But, by declaring it a National project, the government has ensured speedy construction and adequate funding to the project.""This huge construction work will be completed in four years at a cost of Rs 2,979 crore. The contract has been given to the country's leading construction company Larsen and Toubro"", said Gujarat Chief Minister Smt. Anandiben Patel. Rs 1347 crore will be spent on the main statue, Rs 235 crore will be spent on the exhibition hall and convention centre, while Rs 83 crore will be spent on the bridge connecting the memorial to the main land and Rs 657 crore would be spent to maintain the structure until 15 years after it is completed. The 182-metre-tall 'Statue of Unity', which would be double the size of New York's 'Statue of Liberty' (93 metres), would inspire future generations. The project will include an exhibition hall and audio- visual presentation on the life of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, which will become the centre of attraction for tourists from the all over the world. 75,000 cubic metres of concrete, 5,700 metric tonne of steel structure, 18,500 steel rods and 22,500 metric tonne of bronze will be used for the project. It goes without saying that the 'Statue of Unity' project will generate employment in the tribal area of Narmada district as well as boost the tourism sector.The project was launched by the former Gujarat Chief Minister and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 31, 2013, on Sardar Patel's birth anniversary. Shri Modi had also launched a country wide campaign to collect iron to build the 'Statue of Unity' and the Gujarat government has claimed that iron was collected from around seven lakh villages across the nation.It’s indeed a moment of pride for Gujarat that a leader from its soil is getting the honour of getting erected at an unprecedented height. No wonder the whole Gujarat would love to bow before him. But, restricting Sardar Patel to Gujarat will be a dishonour to his work. His work, although started from the state, steadily crossed all the borders to leave an impact over the world and humanity in general. The words of Sardar Patel still resonate all over the world therefore there is no wonder this project was declared as a national one.",Statue of Unity - GlobalSecurity.org,Post-Construction

To let people know of the place, the state governmentin 2009 organised a Chintan Shivir (a three-day brainstorming camp) forIAS officers and the state cabinet.Next, in 2010, the BJP working committee met at the same destination.This raised the area's profile and increased awareness. AmitabhBachchan's advertising campaign added the much-needed glamour quotient.So, even before the start of the Rann Utsav, the area got quality roads, regular power supply and quality water.

"NEW DELHI (AP) —India’s prime minister on Wednesday unveiled a towering bronze statue ofSardar Vallabhbhai Patel, a key independence leader being promoted as anational icon in the ruling party’s campaign ahead of next year’sgeneral elections.Patel,who hailed from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s native Gujarat state,was also India’s first home minister after the 1947 independence fromBritain.He wasknown as the “Iron Man of India” for integrating various states in thepost-independence era, when the creation of Pakistan led to massivebloodshed between Hindus and Muslims moving between the two nations.ADVERTISEMENTThestatue is part of a broader project by Modi to counter the oppositionIndian National Congress Party’s firm claim on India’s history by way ofthe country’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, his mentor, peaceactivist Mahatma Gandhi, and his daughter, former Prime Minister IndiraGandhi, who was assassinated by her guards in 1984.Nehru’sgreat-grandson, Rahul Gandhi, leads the Congress Party, and if aunified opposition wins a majority of seats in parliamentary electionsdue next spring, he could be a candidate for India’s next primeminister.ThePatel statue “puts the opposition in a quandary because any criticism ofModi’s showmanship will enable him to depict critics as being legateesof those who denied Patel his rightful place in the nation and history,”said Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, a Delhi-based political analyst and authorof the book “Modi: The Man, The Times.”“Inthe process, not only will the Statue of Unity literally dwarf statuesof all other Indians leaders, but the event will also enable the memoryof Sardar to rise imposingly over Congress Party leaders,” Mukhopadhyaysaid.At 182meters (597 feet), Patel’s bronze figure in Kevadiya, a village inGujarat, is one of the tallest statues in the world — almost 10 storieshigher than the 153-meter (501-foot) Spring Temple Buddha statue inChina and nearly twice the height of the Statue of Liberty, which standsat 93 meters (305 feet).The42-month project built by 250 engineers and 3,000 workers began in2013, when Modi was the top elected official in Gujarat. After he becameprime minister in 2014, he pledged to complete it despite some criticsbalking at the nearly $403 million price tag, which they said could bebetter spent on welfare programs for India’s poor.ADVERTISEMENTStandingon the banks of the Narmada River on Wednesday as Indian air forcepilots dropped flower petals on Patel’s imposing figure, Modi said thestatue would serve as a beacon of hope for India and “keep on remindingthe whole world” about Patel’s courage.Themonument will have a museum with 40,000 documents, 2,000 photographsand a research center dedicated to Patel’s life and work.“ThoughPatel was from Gujarat state, all Indians were proud of him because ofhis stature,” said Rashesh Patel, a 42-year-old businessman among thecrowd gathered for the inauguration ceremony.ThePatel statue could, however, soon be topped by the 212-meter (696-foot)Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Memorial commemorating a 17th-centuryIndian warrior king, which is set to open in Mumbai in 2021.",Towering statue of India’s independence leader unveiled,Pre-Construction
"On WednesdayPrime Minister Modi unveiled Statue of Unity to mark the occasion ofIndia’s first Home Minister and freedom fighter Sardar VallabhbhaiPatel’s birth anniversary. Hailed as the world’s tallest statue at 182metres, it stands on Sadhu Bet Island on the Narmada in Gujarat.The project cost Rs 2,989 crores and took 42 months to complete. Aroundthe statue there are five other related sites – the walkway, the ticketcounter, the food court, the four-lane approach highway, and the‘Shrestha Bharat Bhavan’- a 52-room three-star lodging facility for thevisitors coming to see the monument.PM Modi in his speechhailed Sardar Patel for “uniting India” and credited him for makingIndia today’s greatest economic and strategic power. Several governmentministers attended the event. PM Modi also said that the statue wouldbring prosperity to the tribals, farmers, and villagers in the region byproviding jobs and encouraging tourism in the region.However, since then many have been quick to point out the irony of his statements. Congress President Rahul Gandhistated that PM Modi is destroying the institutions that freedom fighterhelped build. He tweeted, “Ironic that a statue of Sardar Patel isbeing inaugurated, but every institution he helped build is beingsmashed. The systematic destruction of India’s institutions is nothingshort of treason.” He was perhaps referring to recent events in the CBIas well as RBI, and the election commission among others. He furtherstated, “Sardar Patel was a patriot, who fought for an independent,united & secular India. A man with a steely will, tempered bycompassion, he was a Congressman to the core, who had no tolerance forbigotry or communalism. On his birth anniversary, I salute this greatson of India.”Other critiques have come from those who are pointing out the cost vs benefit of the statue of this scale. IndiaSpend has estimatedthat, “The Statue of Unity, built at an estimated cost of Rs 2,989crore, could have instead funded two new Indian Institute of Technology(IIT) campuses, five Indian Institute of Management (IIM) campuses andsix Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) missions to Mars.”Thousands of tribals and farmers in Gujarat are planning a mass protestagainst the unveiling of the statue. They are unhappy with the cost ofthe project, and with the lack of adequate rehabilitation efforts andwater shortages in the catchment area where the statue is located.It has also been pointed outthat Patel’s birth anniversary falls on the date that Indira Gandhi wasassassinated which from now on will be totally ignored and the officialfocus will shift by attempt to appropriate Patel by the BJP. This toohas been ironical since Patel had always been a staunch criticof the RSS and had it banned after the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi.He had written to Hindu Mahasabha leader Shyama Prasad Mukherjee,“There is no doubt in my mind that the extreme section of the HinduMahasabha was involved in the conspiracy [to kill Gandhi]. Theactivities of the RSS constituted a clear threat to the existence ofGovernment and the State. Our reports show that those activities,despite the ban, have not died down. Indeed, as time has marched on, theRSS circles are becoming more defiant and are indulging in theirsubversive activities in an increasing measure.”In fact Patel was a Congressman and attempts to appropriate him bythe BJP have not gone down well with many. Some are calling it anattempt by PM Modi to equate himself with a strong and decisive leaderlike Patel. Others have termed it as an exercise of vanity. However mostcriticism has centered on the fact that the expense on the statue isunjustified in a largely developing nation with poor economicindicators, dismal health and education, and crumbling infrastructure.Displacement and rehabilitation issues of farmers and tribals have notbeen addressed and financials involved have not been clear – it isreported that Rs 121 crore has come from CSR funds by Oil and NaturalGas Corporation (Rs 50 crore), Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (Rs25 crore), Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (Rs 21.83 crore) and Oil India Ltd(Rs 25 crore).The reaction to the statue has been mixed. The statue is named statueof unity but not inviting the opposition and keeping them out ofcelebrations has been a divisive move. Also we must remember that asection of media that is celebrating this has been critical ofMayawati’s Ambedkar park and statues – something that was pointed out by Mayawatiin her press conference.  In this context perhaps a humbler but morefitting tribute to the iron man of India would have been moreappropriate.",Statue of Unity: What it really means in today’s India,Post-Construction

"In October 2018, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi inaugurated theStatue of Unity, a tribute to Sardar Vallabhai Patel, a freedom fighterand the country’s first deputy prime minister. From the time of itsconception in 2010, the statue, billed as the tallest in the world, hadcome under criticism as an instance of unnecessary expenditure and anattempt to promote jingoism, especially since it is located in a regionwith a high degree of poverty. Last week, the project was hit by anothercontroversy as workers involved in its maintenance went to strike,protesting the non-payment of salaries.Over 100 employees at the site in Modi’s home State of Gujarat havereportedly not been paid for the past three months.

Most of the workers get about Rs. 8,000-10,000(USD 111-138) per month and some supervisors earn Rs. 14,000 (US 194)and perhaps more. These workers have not been paid for the pastthree-four months. Currently, they are resorting to demonstrations andthey even formed a human chain to draw the attention of the government.They cannot resort to any aggressive protests, given the fact they arecontractual workers.”The Central and State governments have sought to portray the statueas a major source of revenue through tourism even as the workersstruggle to sustain themselves. Union tourism minister KJ Alphons, in aparliamentary reply, claimed that the “revenue generated from visitorsto Statue of Unity from November 2018 to January 2019 is Rs.19.47 crore(USD2.7 million),” and “the number of tourists who visited the Statue ofUnity in the three months was 781,349 as against an yearly average of822,009 tourists visiting [the nearby] Sardar Sarovar Dam in the lastfive years.”Responding to this, Mehta added, “This is sheer hypocrisy on the partof the government. Meanwhile, the non-payment of salaries has left theworkers with no alternative.”The Rs 2,989 crore (USD 415 million) project has also faced condemnation for the alleged use of fundsfrom Public Sector Undertakings during its construction.

"Dedicatingthe Statue of Unity to the nation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi onWednesday said it is India's reply to all those who question herexistence and asked all citizens to remain united in countering effortsmade by divisive forces.Unveilingthe 182-metre Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel statue here, Modi also hit outat his critics for politicising the mission for erecting the tallestmonument. ""Statueof Unity is to remind all those who question India's existence and itsintegrity. This country was, is and will always be eternal,"" Modi said. Hesaid that the height of the statue is to remind the youth that thefuture of the country is in their aspirations and is as huge as thisstatue. ""Theonly mantra to fulfil these aspirations are 'Ek Bharat-Shresth Bharat'(One India, Best India). Statue of Unity is also symbolic of ourengineering and technological affordability,"" he added.Keepingthe nation's unity, diversity and sovereignty intact is one suchresponsibility which Patel has given to the countrymen, Modi said.""It'sour responsibility to give reply to every effort of dividing thecountry. We will have to remain vigilant and united as a society,"" hesaid.ThePrime Minister also launched an attack on those opposing his mission ofreviving contributions of historical figures like Sardar Patel,Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Bhimrao Ambedkar and others.""Iam amazed that our efforts are seen with political spectacles.

The Gujarat government expects the statue to boost tourism, with one estimate putting the daily numbers at 15,000.Apartfrom the Patel bronze figure, other major attractions include a17-km-long Valley of Flowers, a Tent City for tourists near the statueand a museum dedicated to the life and times of Patel.

"Towering tribute to a towering leader, the Statue of Unity is abefitting offering to Sri Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the leader parexcellence whose historical contribution in uniting the embattled stateowners post independence is carved in stone. The depth of his wisdom andhis dedication to the cause made scores of kings and landlords cometogether to re-build Bharat. Searching the generally ignored pages ofIndia’s history one can find clear evidences of how it was SardarVallabhbhai who materialized what seemed impossible after the Britishleft a communal mess in the country.While Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, born in 1875 in the state of Gujaratand known as the iron man of India, needs no introduction, what peopledo need to know is his many achievements that outshine many others’ inIndia and abroad. This is a reason, critics say, why there have beenattempts to sideline him all these years. The strikingly massive 182metres (597 ft) tallest statue of the world is an attempt by the presentIndian government to let the Indians, and the world, know how greatSardar Patel actually was.Located on river Narmada’s island in Kevadiya, the truly giganticmonument along with its surroundings cover more than 4.9 acres (2hector) of land which extend further with a newly developed lakestretching to almost 12 square kilometers. The country is spending around INR 3000 crore (approximately USD 425 million) for the projectwhich started on 31st October 2014 and was completed in just about fouryears. On 31 October 2018, which marked Sardar Patel’s 143rd birthanniversary, the Statue of Unity was inaugurated by Indian PrimeMinister Sri Narendra Modi in a grand, national level ceremony. Forobvious reasons, the project and its lavish inauguration ceremony sawcriticism by some political leaders. Better for them would have been toparticipate in the function in a statesman’s spirit.Will the statue of unity bring unity in India?Like everything else in the world, unity also has its own chemistry. Amolecule is formed by a combination of atoms which can live together.Their combination is possible not necessarily because they arelike-minded but because they can work together. In other words, theyunderstand each others’ chemistry and live in unity. Likewise, theanswer  to this question depends on whether the ingredients used in themaking of this project can work together. By ingredients I am referringto desire for giving a befitting tribute to a national leader,appreciating freedom fighters, national pride, communal harmony,political interest, and so on. Ironically, not every good initiativebrings about good results.Flaunted as an icon of freedom, did the Statue of Liberty bringfreedom in the United States? No, if we understand freedom in its realsense, and Yes, if we think of freedom as “anything goes” kind of thing.In any case, the statue of unity brings to the world a much moremeaningful message than it may appear to politicians.The critics of the statue of unity project need to broaden theirvision beyond their narrow-minded views based solely on politicalbenefits. Digging out the history of India’s so-called independence, thedebate whether the previous government of India, namely the IndianNational Congress, deliberately sidelined Sardar Patel seems to havesome merits. On the contrary, every honest observer would agree that thepresent government, namely the BJP, has worked hard to highlight suchsidelined leaders and created awareness of their contribution to therebuilding of this great nation.Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose is another person who has been sidelinedfor decades but the present government has made concrete efforts toaccentuate his terrific contribution in India’s independence movement.Although Netaji Bose brought tremendous pressure on the British, theBritish had strategic reasons not to acknowledge the threat they facedfrom Netaji and his international alliance. Nonetheless, they very wellknew what was coming if they didn’t quit India.  Hence it isunderstandable that they pretended to ignore Netajis’ achievements anddiverted the public attention to M K Gandhi, J L Nehru and a few others.But why even the Indian government did not acknowledge Netaji’scontribution all these decades is another debate that holds definitemerits so far history is concerned.This shows the Indian citizens are not allowed to recognize andappreciate some of their own leaders and well wishers who workedtirelessly for the present generation. I wouldn’t mistake this as mereparty politics. Sardar Patel was a Congress leader but the BJP built theStatue of Unity and unleashed his glories. So the deliberate concealingof the contribution of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Netaji Subhash ChandraBose and many others, seems to carry a murkier purpose than just partypolitics.This is more serious from India’s integrity and security point ofview. Why is a section of country’s own citizens reluctant and evenoppose to glorifying leaders like Sardar Patel and Netaji Bose? What isthere in these leaders that bother them? Are they afraid of losingprominence of other leaders, which in turn would reduce their ownprominence? Or is there something more worrisome that is yet to berevealed?True unity cannot be purchased or imposed. It can only beinspired. Under the present circumstances and the ongoing nasty attemptsby political parties to break the social fabric of India for winningvotes, whether the statue of unity will bring unity remains a toughquestion. Nonetheless, God helps those who help themselves.Read the time-tested wisdom on how to bring unity and peace:“This is the secret. People aretrying to bring in peace and prosperity in the world by so manyactivities—philanthropism, altruism, nationalism, socialism. Andso-called religion also, they are trying to bring in. The whole idea isthe human society should remain in peace and prosperity. And the vividexample is the United Nations in your country. America invited allnations that “Let us form a community of United Nations,” but theAmerica herself is fighting. You see? Because the idea was there tounite, but they do not know the basic principle, how to unite.” (SrilaPrabhupada in Los Angeles, June 7, 1972)“There is United Nations, but whatthey are doing? Let them study Bhagavad Gita, how to make UnitedNations. That will be perfect. Not these short-sighted men, withpolitics and diplomacy in the heart, they can bring all the nationsunited. That is not possible. Let them discuss Bhagavad Gita. Let themdiscuss how perfect society can be established. Then there will bepeace.” (Srila Prabhupada in Stockholm, September 7, 1973)If the people of India can be educated in the right direction andencouraged to develop a true national spirit, it is certainly possibleto bring unity in the country and rebuild Bharat beyond expectations.Why only India, the formula mentioned above can bring unity and peace tothe whole world. That will be an even taller tribute to SardarVallabhbhai Patel.",Will the Statue of Unity bring unity to India?,Post-Construction
"On the first date of this month, that is on the 1st of August, 2020, ithas been two year since the construction of the Statue of Unity So Ifeel like it would be the apt time to analyze how its performance hasbeen Was it successful? Or was it a failure? Come let us analyse it bylooking at the complete data And I'd also like to tell you that in thisvideo, there'd be a personal finance lesson for your personal lives thatyou can learn from this statue Come let us see In the official press ofthe Statue of Unity released on 11th November, there is a data thatreads that from 31st October, 2018 up til 1st November 2019 that is,exactly in between the period of one year, 27 lakh tourists came tovisit it 2.7 million tourists came to see it in the first year Therevenue generation because of these tourists in one year was 80.66 crorerupees Approximately, I'd say this statue earned 80 crore rupees in itsfirst year This number is far higher than my estimations in my video oflast year I'd estimated that on average, around 1 million people wouldcome to see it per year And there'd be a revenue generation of 35 croreper year from it Keeping in mind these numbers, can we conclude that theStatue of Unity has been a profitable and successful project? Disadvantages Of Statue Of Unity  To see the success and profitability of any investment, you need to seeits return on investment Return on investment is how much money you'veinvested and how much money you're getting back So 3000 crore Rupeeswere invested in the Statue of Unity and per year, 80 crore rupees arecoming back Calculating in percentage, 2.7% is the return on investmentof the Statue of Unity What does this 2.7% mean? If you'd deposited Rs3000 crore in a bank, then you'd get 6%return on investment in a savingsbank account Do you understand? Even if you had merely let such a hugeamount of money lie dormant in a bank, then too, it would generate moreprofit than the statue of unity merely by lying dormant in a bank Andyou see an even more critical fact in the inflation rate You mustalready know how the value of money decreases with time due to inflationFoe example, as a fact I'd like to tell you that if you earned 1 lakhrupees in 1984, and you kept that 1 lakh rupees as cash in your house,If you do not use that cash in 2016, the value of that 1 lakh would bemerely 7,600 rupees due to inflation If you look at India's averageinflation rate in the last 10 years, then it would be around 5% And dounderstand that if the return on investment on anything is lesser thanthe inflation rate, then you're bearing a loss there. Your money isgetting wasted if this is happening And the same thing prevails with thestatue of unity Inflation rate is 5%. Return on investment of statue ofliberty is 2.7% And it would be very difficult to maintain this rate ofthe return on investment I believe this would fall further in thefuture And do you know what this means? This means that the 3,000 crorerupees that have been squandered will never be recovered It will neverbe able to recover its cost due to inflation It was able to manage areturn of 2.7% it its first year but in the coming years In my opinion,it is going to decrease steadily because this was the first year andhence was hyped more that there's a statue of unity which is newmonument. The ones interested might have already visited it this yearAnd the number of tourists in the coming years will drop And you musthave seen that this was advertised about a lot Its advertisement couldbe seen from Delhi metro uptil Chennai There isn't an official figure onit, as of November 2019, but there is an official figure of January2019 which stated that in the first two months, 2 crores were spent torun ads for the statue of unity to publicize it in front of people Overthis, add on the employee paying cost, repairing cost and maintenancecost Talking about maintenance, last year there was flooding in thestatue of unity when it was raining nearby  When it rained nearby, the area in the statue- the viewing area gotflooded When they were asked why this was happening, they said that thiswasn't a defect We have designed it in such a way that this will happenHear on, they spent another 2 crores to make another statue near thestatue of unity, in the vicinity Do you know (a statue) of what? Astatue of a dinosaur They invested a further of 2 crore rupees toconstruct the statue of a 30 feet high dinosaur And within a week, thatstatue collapsed I mean... First of all, why are they constructing thisdinosaur statue? Are people not coming to see the statue of unity thatyou're constructing another one and investing money in it? And then too,the quality of the statue was so that even after spending 2 crorerupees, it collapsed This kind of quality means that there would be hugecosts of maintenance and repair in the coming years Summing up, uponseeing the data of one year, it is clear how big of a waste of moneythis statue of unity is But the government will never admit this factThe ministers sitting in the government... What do I tell you? They talksuch pretentious talks You'd be suprised to hear Piyush Goyal ji saysthat in the next 4-5 years, The Statue of Unity would generate a revenueof 1 lakh crores every year... 1 lakh crores! Let us look at some Mathsregarding this I know that Piyush Goyal ji does not like a lot of Mathsbecause according to him, while discovering gravity, Einstein neverused Maths ...""Don't get into those Maths..."" ""those Maths have neverhelped Einstein discover gravity"" Piyush ji, look... Maths does come inhandy The big brags that you claim are exposed with the help of Maths Ifwe assume that 27 lakh visitors come every year to the statue of Unity,To generate 1 lakh crore rupees... 1 lakh crore divides by 27 lakh is3.7 lakh rupees That is, every visitor will have to buy a ticlet of 3.7lakh rupees if this amount of revenue has to be generated Another thingwhich they do is spread fake news to conceal their mistakes theycirculate false whats app forwards  A  similar fake Whatsapp forward poster went viral which claims thatthe Statue of unity attracts more visitors than the Taj Mahal Thisposter reads that the merely 7 lakh 50 thousand people came to see theTaj Mahal per year whereas 26 lakh people came to see the Statue ofUnity This is clearly a lie According to the Lok Sabha data, in the oneyear between 2016-17, Taj Mahal had 60 lakh vistors This number is a lotmore than the number on the Staue of Unity.. it is almost double Andyou can guess who spreads fake news like this.. It is written on theposter itself Nation with Namo You might remember that Nation with Namois a very popular page on Facebook that eulogizes Modi This page spentmore than 1 crore rupees during the time of elections over facebook adsAds that spread fake propaganda and brainwash people And you yourselfcan confirm this figure of 1crore rupees How much is spent by Facebookpages on ads is a publicly available information Go to the Facebookpage, click on the ""i"" button you will get to see how much money theFacebook page has invested in ads And this page, which spreads fake newslike this, has invested 1 crore rupees But coming back to the topic, Ihad said that there is a a financial tip for you in this video It mightbe that you have already understood what that is The tip is that if youinvest money somewhere and the return of investment is lesser than theinflation rate, then you need to understand that this means a loss ofmoney for you For example if a friend tells you to invest in hisbusiness and promises to pay you a certain sum back every year Hepromises a certain amount of profit every year Then you have yo see howmuch money you have invested, and what percentage of it you are gettingback each year So this is a a very small but basic personal finance tipthat is valid every where regardless of whether you invest it in gold,property, FD or mutual funds But do keep in mind that there are someinvestments in which you do not have to view return of  investment interms of money There are some investments that can give you returns inother ways For example, buying property Property is also giving you ahouse to live in so in that sense it will be a better return ofinvestment if not viewed only in terms of money  Similarly, if our government uses our tax money to build hospitals andschools the return of investment there isn't huge in the terms of moneyBut we get better facilities and we can send our kids to study in schoolwho can then better utilize these better facilities to imbibe a bettereducation So in that sense, it is a better return of investment in otheraspects Now I know what some people will comment here They might saythat the Statue of Unity may not be a good return of investment in termsof money But it is a very good tourist site, it is giving jobs topeople So many people are getting employment because of it But thislogic does not fit well Because had that been the main purpose, ifgiving jobs and employment to the people was the main purpose, then itcould've been done in a better way The government could have opened askill development centre instead of constructing a statue, which wouldenable more people to get jobs Then some people would say but it isatleast a tourist attraction which is providing people with a return ofinvestment in the sense of enjoyment In the sense of enjoying a touristBut this does not fit well either because if they had to invest moneyfrom the point of a tourist attraction, then this could have been donein a much better way A very good example of this is the video I made onthe Jatayu statue They have made a much better tourist attraction onlyin 100 crores",Negative impact of Statue of Unity Advantages And Disadvantages,Post-Construction
"On October 31, when Narendra Modi inauguratedthe massive ‘Statue of Unity’, he was fulfilling at least one promise ofhis government. On many other fronts, this government has flounderedand failed – neither has black money come back into the country (or inanyone’s account) nor have jobs increased. Crony capitalism, poorgovernance, and a rank failure to bring fugitive businessmen to justicehave marked the Modi government’s tenure. Add to that an inability orunwillingness to control Hindutva mobs that is going berserk and thepicture is complete.But he did say he would build this monumental statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and he has. The financesinvolved are controversial, local farmers are said to be unhappy andthe Make in India slogan sounds hollow given the external panels of thestatue were made in China and the CAG has raised questions about CSRmoney being used for the purpose, but here we are, with a structure thatis the ‘tallest statue in the world’; there is nothing that we Indianslove more than making it to the Guinness Book of Records and this onecertainly will.By one of those coincidences that work well for this dispensation,Patel’s birth anniversary falls on October 31, also the date on whichIndira Gandhi was assassinated and which can now be totally ignored.From now onwards, all official focus on this day every year will be onPatel rather than Indira Gandhi, just like December 25 was convertedinto Good Governance Dayand Modi had suggested that Gandhi Jayanti be celebrated as ‘SwacchOctober 2’; already there are demands to shift children’s day fromNovember 14. This way, all the reviled Nehru-Gandhis and the barelytolerated Mahatma Gandhi can be sidelined.Also read: Statue of Unity: An Open Letter to Sardar Patel by Medha PatkarPatel has beenappropriated by Modi and his parivar, not the least because he can beportrayed as the anti-Nehru, despite all the historical evidence againstthat assumption. The ‘he should have been prime minister’ narrative isan old one and has got a boost in recent years. That he had banned theRSS doesn’t get a mention. Patel has his uses and by promoting the ‘IronMan’ assiduously, Modi hopes that some of the stardust will settle onhim.But what will the same Sardar who worked hard to knit the Indianunion during those critical years and brought in more than 500 rulers,some of them reluctant, under one administrative unit, see when hesurveys today’s India from his perch up there? How will he perceive thecountry 70 years after Independence, when the nation, despite all itsproblems, had looked with hope towards the future as a unified entity,where people of all faiths, communities, ethnic backgrounds, would livetogether in peace and harmony? Will he think that those dreams have beenrealised? Or will he see a land increasingly fractured?In Kerala, he will see an aggressive attemptto defy a Supreme Court verdict that allows women between the ages of10 and 50 to enter the Sabarimala temple and a warning by the boss ofthe ruling party that it would ‘uproot’ the Kerala government if itarrests those protesting against the Court’s order.In Kashmir, he will see the Indian security forces shooting pelletsinto the crowd, blinding young children. Maharashtra, which, along withGujarat, was part of the old Bombay state, was where Dalits were beaten upfor attending a commemoration of a big event in their history. Inneighbouring Rajasthan, and many other places, the Sardar will seefamilies in mourning after a member was lynched.Also read: Why the Statue of Unity Hasn’t Quite Generated the Euphoria BJP CravedAnd of course, he will definitely notice the rising communaltemperature as once again, the Sangh parivar and its affiliates rake upthe issue of the Ayodhya temple, long dormant but pulled out onstrategic occasions to consolidate the Hindus against the ‘enemy’, theMuslim citizens of India. This formula may or may not work this timeround and the electorate may not respond in the same way as in the1990s, but it has the potential to create great havoc.AcrossIndia, there is ferment, caused by forces who want to impose theiragenda of creating a nation of one people, one religion, one languageand one thought. Others are welcome to join if they agree to submitthemselves to the majority, to agree that to being second classcitizens. This is not the India Sardar Patel, along with Gandhi andNehru and so many others, fought for and went to jail for. Modi andfriends have tried to hitch their wagon to Patel but no one is fooled;the RSS was nowhere in the freedom struggle and the attempt to distorthistory will not work.What is the message of this statue, apart from the sheer vanity oferecting a tall edifice and boasting about its height? The symbolism isobvious – it allows Modi to assert in this election year, that Indianeeds a strongman at the Centre to ensure the country does not slideinto chaos. This is going to be a theme in the run up to theelections-the need for a decisive leader who should be given not justfive but many more years to steady the nation’s ship and steer ittowards its manifest destiny. Already those in the government have begunto say that. But it is Patel’s image they want, not his message – ofcoming down on communal forces and lawless elements who provoke violencein the name of religion, or his ability to work with other tall leadersdespite his differences with them, or indeed how the Sardar banned theRSS. Modi will not  hail the great diversity of India, which is at thefoundation of our unity. That is certainly not the unity he had in mindwhen he commissioned this statue.",A Statue of Unity in a Nation Increasingly Disunited,Pre-Construction
"Narendra Modi said that if Sardar would have become the PrimeMinister of the country, the country’s future would have been different.He then went on to explain the vision of the great Sardar.Dr.Manmohan Singh responded by reading out a speech ( which disprovesthe point that he was reacting to Modi ) that Sardar Patel was aCongressman and he fought for the principles of secularism throughouthis life.As part of the orchestra, Manish Tewari and others jumped into thefray on Main stream media and social network that Sardar Patel’s legacycannot be appropriated and that he was a Congressman and other partiesdont have any history etc etc..Now let us have the facts :1. This is not the first time that someone has said that Patel wouldhave been a better Prime Minister than Nehru. C.Rajagpolachary, who wasthe Governor General of India said If Nehru was Foreign Minister andPatel the Prime minister, it would be undoubtedly better.2. The legacy of the great national leaders is not the property of asingle political party. The Indian National Congress ,pre-independencewas a vehicle in which people of many political hues participated intheir quest for freedom. The legacy of those leaders belong to theentire nation and not to one political party. It is for this reason thatMahatma Gandhi resolved to disband the Congress after Independence.Mahatma Gandhi wrote ” Though split into two, India having attainedpolitical independence through means provided by the Indian NationalCongress, the Congress in its present shape and form, i.e., as apropaganda vehicle and parliamentary machine, has outlived its use.India has still to attain social, moral and economic independence interms of its seven hundred thousand villages as distinguished from itscities and towns. The struggle for the ascendancy of civil over militarypower is bound to take place in India’s progress towards its democraticgoal. It must be kept out of unhealthy competition with politicalparties and communal bodies. For these and other similar reasons, the A.I. C .C. resolves to disband the existing Congress organization andflower into a Lok Sevak Sangh under the following rules, with power toalter them as occasion may demand.(*Gandhiji’s idea of a transformed Congress was published in Harijanunder the title “His Last Will and Testament”. Also published in ‘TheCollected Works of Mahatma Gandhi – Volume 90’, published by the UnionMinistry of Information and Broadcasting’s publication division in 1984.Can the Congress leaders explain why Mahatma Gandhi who as per themis the sole architect of freedom was completly ignored in this essentialpoint ? Does it not show the power-hungry nature of Nehru and his ilk ?3. Let us now come to Dr.Manmohan Singh’s certificate of Sardar Patelthat he is indeed a secularist. The only certificate of “Secularism” inIndia must come from the Congress because they own the meaning of thisword. ” Secularism” in Bharat i.e., India means the opposite of what itis worldwide.In his book ” With No Ill-Feeling to Anybody”, Sri MKK Nair, an IASofficer of the 1947 batch who was close both to Sardar and VPMenon,writes“Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the then Deputy Prime Minister and HomeMinister of India, was insulted, humiliated and disgraced by the thenPrime Minister, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, during a Cabinet meeting. “Youare a complete communalist and I’ll never be a party to your suggestionsand proposals,” Nehru shouted at Patel during a crucial Cabinet meetingto discuss the liberation of Hyderabad by the Army from the tyranny ofthe Razakkars, the then Nizam’s private army.A shocked Sardar Patel collected his papers from the table andslowly walked out of the Cabinet room. That was the last time Patelattended a Cabinet meeting. He also stopped speaking to Nehru sincethen.”So RSS is not the only one that Nehru called communal. He had those kind words for the then own Dy.Prime Minister, Sardar Patel.4. Manish Tewari, Congress MP, ( Information & BroadcastingMinister ) ,in an interview to a news channel, quotes a letter by SardarPatel to Guru Golwalkar of the RSS dated 11th Sept 1948. “On9/11/1948, Sardar Patel wrote a letter to Golwalkarji. And, in thatletter, he said that the communal poison which had been spread by theRSS was responsible for the sacrifice of Gandhiji. As a student ofpolitical history, it has always intrigued me that the RSS, BJP has beenattempting unsuccessfully to appropriate the legacy of Sardar Patel. Iwanted to ask the BJP or their newly-anointed pretender that do theyendorse, or agree with the views of Sardar Patel with regard to the RSS.If not, as the chief minister of Gujarat and possibly as the‘Swayamsevak’ within history bears testimony to the fact that those whodo not have a history of their own, try to appropriate the history ofothers,” he added. Tewari said the Indian freedom struggle wasconceived, conceptualized and led by the Indian National Congress. “Theunification of India was also the result of the efforts of the IndianNational Congress. So, therefore, it would be advisable before you tryand appropriate legacy to at least study it carefully,” he added.In the same letter that Tewari cites , the Sardar wrote ,“There can be no doubt that the RSS did service to the Hindu society. Inthe areas where there was the need for help and organization, the youngmen of the RSS protected women and children and strove much for theirsake. No person of understanding could have a word of objectionregarding that” and he writes further “ I am thoroughly convinced thatthe RSS men carry on their patriotic endeavour only by joining theCongress and not by keeping separate or by opposing. ” Source: Justiceon TrialIt is clear that he wanted the Sangh to join Congress for whatever reasons he deemed fit.Therefore, it would be nice if a student of political history as Tewariclaims himself to be, he goes through the entire documentation.What is further interesting is the following correspondence:After removal of the ban on the RSS on 12 July 1949, Sardar Patel wrote aletter to Shri Guruji on this occasion and made a telling remark: ‘Onlythe people near me know as to how happy I was when the ban on Sangh waslifted. I wish you all the best.’Any person who is genuine and wants to present the truth, would havementioned the whole correspondence between Sardar Patel and GurujiGolwalkar and not quote as it suits him. It clearly exposes the liesthat Manish Tewari and his ilk are indulging in.5 . How the Efforts by the Congress to malign RSS ContinueInspite of all the direct evidence, the Congress did not end at this, In1966, Nehru’s daughter, Indira Gandhi appointed another commissionunder Justice JL Kapur, a retd judge of Supreme Court. It examined over100 witnesses and submited a report in 1969. The Kapur Commissionreport said ”…RSS as such were not responsible for the murder of Mahatma Gandhi,meaning thereby that one could not name the organisation as such asbeing responsible for that most diabolical crime, the murder of theapostle of peace. It has not been proved that they (the accused) weremembers of the RSS..”8. In his speeches, after the ban was lifted, Shri Guruji endearedhimself to many people outside the Sangh ranks with his magnanimity andmoderation. ‘Let us close this chapter of the ban on the Sangh,’ he toldswayamsevaks and RSS sympathisers. ‘Do not let your minds be overcomewith bitterness for those who, you feel, have done injustice to you. Ifthe teeth were to bite the tongue do we pull out the teeth? Even thosewho have done injustice to us are our own people. So we must forget andforgive.”Compare this with Nehru’s mean and jealous attitude of sideliningeveryone who opposed in his way, so much so, that he arm-twisted evenMahatma Gandhi to name him as the Prime Minister when 12 out of 15Congress committees named the Sardar over him as their Prime Ministerialchoice.Both Nehru and his daughter Indira Gandhi tried falsely implicate theRSS in the Gandhi murder. Nehru’s great-grandson, Rahul Gandhicontinues to harp on the “people who killled Gandhi”. Having failed intheir efforts, the Congress leaders & the communists continue toraise the bogey of Hindu communalism every now and then in a lowlyattempt to garner votes and keep the country in a state of uncertainty. .The only difference is that the nation is seeing through their game !Encl :Annexure A – More Information on the Ban on the RSSAnnexure AMore Information on the Ban on RSSThe subject of the ban on RSS in connection with Gandhiji’s murder needssome more attention. It is clear that Sardar Patel was of the opinionthat the RSS was not involved in Gandhiji’s murder. This fact is evidentfrom the correspondence between Patel and Nehru. Replying to the PrimeMinister’s letter urging him to ascertain the RSS connection in thecase, Patel sent a categorical reply on 27 February 1948, less than amonth after Gandhiji’s assassination: ‘I have kept myself almost indaily touch with the progress of the investigations regarding Bapu’sassassination case. All the main accused have given long and detailedstatements of their activities. It also clearly emerges from thestatements that the RSS was not involved in it at all.’Therefore, it is clear that it was on Nehru’s insistence and somelater fictitious reports from some of the state leaders that forcedPatel to impose the ban on the RSS.Shri Guruji was arrested again on the night of 13 November 1948 underthe notorious Bengal State Prisoner’s Act. It was the very Act whichNehru had condemned before Independence as a ‘black law’. Soon after hisarrest, Shri Guruji wrote a letter to all the swayamsevaks: ‘This stateof affairs is humiliating. To continue to submit meekly to thisatrocious tyranny is an insult to the honour of citizens of free Bharatand a blow to the prestige of our civilised free State. I thereforerequest you to stand up for our great cause.’ He gave a call fornationwide satyagraha on 9 December 1948. The main slogan of thesatyagrahis was a blatant challenge to the Nehru government: ‘Prove thecharges against the RSS or lift the ban.’The satyagraha was a huge success all over the country. Thegovernment soon realised that public opinion was going against ShriGuruji’s illegal arrest. So in order to break the stalemate, Patelcommunicated a request to Shri Guruji to prepare a written constitutionfor the RSS and to send it to the Government of India for its perusal.Until then, the RSS had been functioning without a constitution. ShriGuruji readily agreed to this suggestion and the text of the Sangh’sconstitution was sent to the government in June 1949. This paved the wayfor removal of the ban on the RSS on 12 July 1949, followed by ShriGuruji’s release the following day.On a side note, it is interesting to note that after the ban waslifted, Shri Guruji embarked on an all-India tour in August 1949,touring the country extensively for six months. Wherever he went, hereceived a tumultuous welcome. The massive ovation he got in Delhi on 23August 1949 attracted international attention. BBC radio reported:‘Golwalkar is a shining star that has arisen on the Indian firmament.The only other Indian who can draw such huge crowds is Prime MinisterNehru.’This explains why Nehru was so insistent on banning the RSS. It wasprobably because he saw a potential political threat in the RSS to him.","controversy over Statue of Unity – Sardar Patel, Nehru and the RSS",Pre-Construction
"Why should a statue of Sardar Patel cause controversy? Is it becauseit is the tallest statue in the world? Or, is it because itsinauguration was an extravaganza choreographed by the PM? Or, is itbecause it cost — as per reports — something in the vicinity of Rs 3,000crore? Other reasons have been cited too. Is erecting statues out offashion and a waste of money? Or — as some people have said — wouldSardar Patel have been less than happy at this kind of spectacle in hisname? Perhaps, there are even those who feel that Sardar Patel does notdeserve this kind of glorification. Or, maybe, the Congress is annoyedat the “appropriation” of Sardar Patel by PM Narendra Modi and the BJP.And, finally, there could be some who feel that such tributes are bestpursued only for the Nehru-Gandhi parivar.To the critics of this statue, I say simply, choose from any of theseoptions. As far as I am concerned, a befitting tribute to the Iron Manof India was long overdue. If his statue in his home state has beenerected, and is the tallest statue in the world, so be it. For too long,the Nehru-Gandhi family has tended to monopolise all such tributes, andby doing so, has pushed to the relative margins other iconic figures ofthe Freedom Movement, and of India’s recent history. When Pandit Nehrudied, his home was converted into a museum. That was the firstoverreaction. A home once designated for the first Prime Minister of thecountry should have been the residence for future PMs as well, muchlike, for example, 10 Downing Street is. I am of the firm opinion thatthere is no better address for the PM of our country than Teen MurtiBhavan. It has the right location, size, and suitability for protocolrequirements. Instead of that, we now have our PMs living in animprovised residence which clumsily combines three bungalows.We seem to be congenitally disposed to create museums to honour ourPMs. Former PM Indira Gandhi’s residence is also a museum now. Theairport in the capital is named after her, too. Connaught Place, anotherlandmark in the capital, is now called Rajiv Gandhi Chowk. Thecapital’s premier National Centre for the Arts bears Indira Gandhi’sname. New Delhi’s largest stadium is named after Jawaharlal Nehru. Thereis the Jawaharlal Nehru University too in the capital. The country’slargest open university — also in the capital — is named after hisdaughter. Apart from this, there are huge swathes of priceless realestate marked for the final resting place of Jawaharlal Nehru, IndiraGandhi and Rajiv Gandhi. The city’s only planetarium is in the name ofNehru. The capital’s largest cancer hospital is named after hisgrandson.These are only some examples, and restricted to New Delhi, but theyclearly indicate that there has been an excess. Since the Nehru-Gandhiswere in power for most of the last seven decades, it is not difficult tounderstand why this happened. The role of sycophants, forever ready tosuggest what they believe will appeal to those in power, must haveplayed a role too. Of course, none of this is intended, even for amoment, to belittle the contributions of Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhior Rajiv Gandhi. They served the nation with great distinction, andneed to be remembered. Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi gave their lifefor the nation. This can never be forgotten. Jawaharlal Nehru, inparticular, is someone I hugely admire. In fact, in my study, there is ablack and white photograph of Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, andthis is the permanent backdrop to my participation in TV debates.   However, this does not make me blind to the fact that there wereother leaders in the pantheon of our Freedom Movement, and in the makingof more recent Indian history, who have not got their due. Theallegedly shabby manner in which the Congress Party — then in power atthe Centre — dealt with the body of the late PM P.V. Narasimha Rao, is acase in point. Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, and later, Lal BahadurShastri, did not get their due either. There were other iconic leaders,like Ram Manohar Lohia, who remained sidelined. Sardar Patel sufferedthe same neglect. The BJP is obviously trying to do a course correction. Some leadersof eminence from the BJP stock, like Deen Dayal Upadhyaya, have suddenlyshot into prominence, knocking off the names of well-establishedrailway stations like Moghul Serai. But the BJP has a paucity of iconicfigures linked to the Freedom Movement. Hence the need for appropriatingfigures like Sardar Patel. The appellation “Iron Man” appeals, I think,to a person like Narendra Modi. There is, undoubtedly, an irony in thisnew-found deification. The BJP, which is joined at the hip to the RSS,has internalised a convenient amnesia about what Sardar Patel actuallythought of the RSS. He was unrelentingly critical of RSS ideology, andmade no secret of it. Perhaps, the BJP thinks that the size of thestatue will make people forget this part of Patel’s legacy.   But all this notwithstanding, a tribute to the Iron Man of India,cannot — and should not — be made a matter of controversy. The moneyspent on the statue could have been less, but it is hardly a materialfactor, given the thousands of crores spent on remembering other greatleaders, mostly from the Nehru-Gandhi family. The contribution of SardarPatel to the Freedom Movement is immeasurable. The resolve of steel hedisplayed in uniting India — earning for himself the sobriquet of“Bismarck of India” — is something that can never be forgotten. He was atrue Gandhian, a peasant leader of great sensitivity and acumen, andthe founder of the modern all-Indian civil services system. As theintegrator of the Republic of India, the Statue of Unity dedicated tohim on October 31, 2018, deserves the support of every patriotic Indian.",A befitting tribute to Patel was long overdue,Post-Construction
"Soon after it came to power, the state government announced plans tobuild a memorial to Chhatrapati Shivaji on a rocky outcrop in theArabian Sea. The BJP government was merely taking forward theCongress-NCP’s plans. “The decision to build the Shivaji memorial wastaken by the Congress-NCP government in July 2005,” said former chiefminister Prithviraj Chavan. “The final government resolution was passedby us in February 2014.”The bronze statue will be located about 1.2km southwest of RajBhavan, and the proposed project area comes under the jurisdiction ofthe Port of Mumbai. The state government approved the location of thesite via a government resolution issued in February 2014. When complete,the 400-feet tall statue, expected to be unveiled in 2019, will betaller than the Statue of Liberty in New York. The entire project willcost Rs 3,600 crore, and the memorial will also house a temple dedicatedto goddess Tuljabhavani (Shivaji’s tutelary deity), an art museum, alibrary, an auditorium and an amphitheatre among others. The manoverseeing the work on the statue is Delhibased sculptor Ram Sutar. “Thehard part is already over. Half the battle was won when we completedconstruction of a 25-feet model at our studio in Noida,” Sutar told Mirror.He added that the actual construction on the site would take more than ayear, and estimated that 2000-odd workers would need to work round theclock to finish it on time. Sutar, who is also constructing a monumentof Sardar Vallabhai Patel (‘The Statue of Unity’) in Gujarat, said thataround 1,700 tonnes of bronze would be needed for the construction ofthe statue. The first phase of the project will be completed by 2019,and the second by 2021. On Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi willbe in Mumbai to inaugurate the construction of the project. According toVinayak Mete, chairperson of the Chhatrapati Shivaji MemorialCommittee, “This is a matter of great pride for the state and thecountry. It will be a great tourist attraction.”WHICH DEPARTMENTS HAVE APPROVED THE PROJECT?Between 2014 and 2016, the project received no-objection certificatesfrom the Ministry of Forest, Environment and Climate Change; TheWestern Naval Command; Coast Guard; Coastal Regulation Zone ManagementAuthority; Mumbai Police, the BMC, Bombay Natural History Society andthe Department of Fisheries among others. But, Prithivraj Chavan said,“Only NoCs are not enough. The government should put up all thenecessary permission on its website, especially since this project isbeing inaugurated by the prime minister.”WHAT DO MUMBAI’S FISHERMEN HAVE A PROBLEM WITH?The Machhimar Kruti Samiti, a federation of different fishermenunions, had a meeting regarding the statue with chief minister DevendraFadnavis on Wednesday, and will be meeting senior minister MahadeoJankar on Thursday. Jankar is expected to talk them out of agitatingagainst the construction of the statue on December 24. The fishermen arenot against the monument per se, but they do have an issue with itsproposed location. “If they build this huge statue here, it is going toaffect our livelihood. Fish breeding sites will be affected. Over 30types of fish breed in the area, and over 250 fishing boats operate inthose waters,” said Leo Colaco of Macchimar Kruti Samiti. Instead of thechosen location, the fishermen have suggested seven other sites,including Ambu Island near Madh, Khar Danda and Uttan.According to the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) report, theroutes of ferries carrying tourists from Nariman Point and the Gatewayof India will pass through the fishing areas, and hence, these boatswould interfere with local fishing activities.“We have had a series of meetings with the fishermen, and haverequested them not to protest on the day the prime minister is here.But, if they still continue with their plans, it will be a law and orderissue and the police will have to handle it,” said BJP leader VinayakMete, who is chairman of the committee formed to supervise thememorial’s construction.WHAT DO THE ENVIRONMENTALISTS HAVE TO SAY?Debi Goenka, executive trustee and founder of the Conservation ActionTrust, has questioned the proposed project. “Shivaji Maharaj is arespected warrior in the country. But, all the forts he built aresuffering due to the government’s apathy. Why is the governmentdedicating a memorial to a warrior who spent most of his life in theSahyadri mountains?” According to Goenka, the state government shouldhave had a mandatory public consultation before making the EIA of theproject.“The EIA was done overnight. If the hearing had taken place, then allviews, including those of fishermen and environmentalists, would havebeen heard.” Goenka also said that there have been reports of thepresence of corals around the site, and the presence of corals indicatesthat it is an ecologically sensitive location. “The outcrop is special.It is submerged during high tide and has a fragile eco-system. Theproject will destroy the little island.”Goenka warned that the huge number of boats ferrying tourists, andthe consequent littering that will take place in the waters, will onlymake matters worse. Environmentalist Girish Raut said, “Sea levels inMumbai are increasing. Apart from this statue, we also have the CoastalRoad coming up and mangroves are being destroyed to accommodate Metro 3.If we look at these in totality, we are in for a tough time.”Journalist Karishma Upadhyay took to the internet to petitionFadnavis and Modi. Over 11,000 people have signed the petition in justtwo days. “This is tax-payers’ money, and I am sure we would all likethis money to be spent on something better — education, infrastructure,food…,” Upadhyay argued in her petition.According to the EIA report, the construction of the statue wouldmean noise pollution that will affect marine life; environmentalpollution caused by vessels and barges; and an adverse impact on airquality. The EIA has also warned that illumination during constructionand post construction would affect marine birds and fish. It has saidthat the artificial illumination would confuse them and affect theirbreeding and foraging patterns.",KING-SIZED CONTROVERSY,Post-Construction
"Withoutfurther delay, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the world’stallest statue of Sardar Vallabbhai Patel at Gujarat’s Narmada districton October 31, in the wake of the general elections 2019. The 182-metrecolossal statue of freedom fighter Patel, also named as ‘Statue ofUnity’, unsurprisingly, failed to unite the massive population ofAdivasi farmers and tribal villagers, who had to sacrifice theireverything — homes, lands, farms and work — for the Rs. 3000 crore megaproject to come to life. The villagers have firmly stated that the‘Statue of Unity’ is nothing more than a waste of “hard-earned money ofthe public,” which could have been better utilised in establishingschools, hospitals, sanitation, drinking water facilities, which arestill a distant dream for the areas adjacent to Kevadiya where thestatue stands today. They even said that this prejudice and unfairnessis mainly because they “belong to Adivasi and tribal communities and notPatel community.”Ifthat wasn’t enough, only after the unveiling of the ‘Statue of Unity’,around 300 activists were released from the arrests who warned to hold ademonstration on the day of the launch, October 31, a way to dissuadethe dissents. For a while now, there has been a vehement protest by theAdivasi farmers and Gujarat’s tribals. Many activists, locals,politicians were detained in many areasAlso,signed by 22 village Sarpanchs (headmen), in an open letter to the PMon October 31, they wrote that he (PM) is not welcome in their villagesfor neglecting their rights and going ahead with the project.

The letter reads: “If Sardar Patel could see the massdestruction of natural resources and injustice done to us, he would cry.When we are raising our issues, we are persecuted by police. Why youare not ready to listen to our plight?”ActivistLakhan Musafir, who was arrested along with 23 Adivasi protestors,after being released from police station said that the anger andfrustration of the villagers are genuine as in the last month, almostsix villages around Garudeshwar area had to lose acres of lands due togovernment’s apathy as the water from the dam was released withoutgiving any warnings to the farmers.It’spertaining to note that over 15 villages in the Narmada district wereaffected (and still living with difficulties) when Sardar Sarovar Damproject was established in 1990s.FormerChief Minister of Gujarat Suresh Mehta has stated that the 182-metrecolossal ‘Statue of Unity’ project is “illegal” and that it is apolitical gimmick of the BJP-led government to woo the vote bank of the unhappy Patels or Patidars in the upcoming general election 2019.“Underthe PESA Act, decisions taken by gram sabhas are final and binding.But, when tribals of that area, through gram sabhas, raised objectionsagainst the project, the state government did not listen. This is aviolation of the Act. This project is also illegal because thegovernment did not conduct any environmental impact assessment. It isonly meant for publicity. It is a politically-motivated project keepingin mind the 2019 elections,” Mehta was quoted as saying to reporters.Whilespeaking with media person, a local tribal from Vagadiya village,Shailesh Tadvi, said, “Land of six villges were first acquired by thegovernment in the 1960s for the main dam project.

The hilarious scene ends up when the 'dictator'literally falls on the ground before his honourable guest.One was reminded of this scenewhen news came in that a tallest statue in the memory of SardarVallabhbhai Patel is being built in the Western state of Gujarat at thebehest of Narendra Modi, the Prime Ministerial candidate of BJP.According to the plan it will be double the size of ‘Statue of Liberty’in the US (the height of the Statue of liberty is 93 meters) and fourtimes higher than the statue of ‘Christ the Redeemer’ located in Rio DeJaneiro. It is going to be built by Turner Construction of US which isreputed for building many famous and giant structures such as BurjDubai, the Yankee Stadium of New York etc. The project cost is estimatedto be Rs. 2500 crore and the consultancy fees of Turner itself will beto the tune of Rs. 61 Crores. Only a few days back the main oppositionParty BJP organised 'Run for Unity' at hundreds of places across Indiawherein its top leaders also participated as part of its efforts to givethis pet project of Mr Modi a big push.We are being told that afterthis event, the members of the party as well as other volunteers of the'Parivar' would reach out to people, communicating to them the'importance of this project' and would collect iron from them whichwould supposedly be used in the construction of this upcoming monument.Looking at the fact that Sardar Patel happened to be a farmer, specialemphasis would be paid towards them in this campaign and would bepersuaded that they donate at least one iron tool for making the 25,000tonne statue.Perhaps all those who areconversant with the 'Parivar' trajectory would recollect that more thantwo decades back it had used a similar programme to reach out to peopleto popularise its other project of Ram Mandir to be built in Ayodhyaaiming to replace a five hundred year old Babri Mosque and had collectedmillions of bricks for the purpose from different corners of thecountry.(As an aside it may be mentioned here that today all thosebricks are lying in the godowns of the Hindutva organisations) and thesaid campaign to 'correct historical wrongs' had resulted in nationwidecommunal riots after the demolition of Babri Mosque.According to the website (www.statueofunity.com)the said statue '[w]ill be located at Sadhu Bet, an island situated 3kilometers away from the Sardar Sarovar Dam in Gujarat. The SardarSarovar Dam is gravity dam built on the river Narmada and is a part ofNarmada Valley Project. The height of the statue is 182 metres whichmakes it the tallest one in the world. It is also one of the largestprojects of the country. Tourists have to embark in a boat to reach thestatue."" The project would be owned by Gujarat government’s sponsoredtrust, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust (SVPRET).This memorial will have amuseum on the life of Sardar Patel and also a research centre whichwould ""promote research on matters such as good governance, agriculturetechnology and development for the tribal population which were corematters of importance Sardar Patel. There will be the facility of liftfor the visitors to go to the top of the constitution and able to enjoyeye catching sight of the Sardar Sarovar Dam.""Interestingly the media - thesupposed watchdog of democracy - or rather its majority has refused toput the grand project under scanner over its ‘Social, Economic andEnvironmental Impacts’ nor the manner in which it allegedly '[v]iolatesthe law of the land, constitution of India and concerns of poor, tribalsand environment'And the reasons for the sameare not difficult to understand as it is becoming increasingly clearthat with the Congress, loosing its legitimacy because of corruption andunbearable price rise and appearing to be dilly dallying on variousissues of concern to the moneyed and the corporates, there is growingclamour for a 'decisive' leader at the top among the rich and thepriviledged. And Modi's pro-corporate image rather fits the bill. Infact it has been quite some time that the Corporates have unashamedlyjoined the chores of 'Modi for PM' .For them the carnage of 2002 inGujarat when Modi happened to be Chief Minister of the state and hasbeen castigated for his alleged connivance or eneptness in handling thesituation is just a matter of detail and cannot put his supposedleadership qualities into question. They also do not want to rememberthat his own Party's seniormost leader - namely Atal Bihari Vajpayee whohappened to be Prime Minister then - had even questioned his sense of'Rajdharma'.IIMainstream media's silence hasnot deterred activists concerned with people's welfare and a life ofdignity to everyone to expose how '[b]oth Mr. Narendra Modi, the chiefminister of Gujarat who laid the foundation stone for “Statue of Unity”and his office, the CM’s Secretariat are either clueless or do not wantto give a categorical reply when asked about the missing ‘EnvironmentClearance’ for the proposed “Statue of Unity Project”.This group of activists hadwritten to the Principal Secretary, Ministry of Environment and Forests,copying the details to the Gujarat Chief Minister and Gujarat chiefsecretary, Gujarat Principal Secretary, Forest and EnvironmentDepartment and member secretary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel RashtriyaEkta Trust on 7 November 2013 raising there concerns about ‘Environment.Social and Safety’ issues related to the “Statue of Unity Project”.According to a Press Releaseissued by them they "".[r]eceived a letter from the CM’s secretariatwhich instead of being clear on its actions to seek ‘EnvironmentalClearance’ from the competent authority forwarded our representation tothe Gujarat State’s two departments.

They areof the opinion that ""the Gujarat government authorities responsible forprocessing and/or granting ‘Environment Clearances’ are keeping silent,while the Chief Minister’s Secretariat refuses to provide clear answer.""With their communique which wasissued to the press few days before the grand programme called 'Run forUnity' - held on 15 th December 2013 - they had shared their concerns,questions, worries including the glaring issues and procedural anomaliesand had appealed to the people who intended to participate in theprogramme about why they were raising the question about need for socialand environment impact assessment, “Environment Clearance”, democraticdecision making process and why they should also know and discuss theseworries. They had also requested all such people to 'ask Mr. NarendraModi and his government to answer the valid legal and moral questionsraised by us before joining the run with the euphoria created in Gujaratand across India by Mr. Narendra Modi and BJP to play electoralpolitics in the name of Shree Sardar Patel.'The communique had concludedwith a poser ""Why should be citizens and students be made party to agovernment project which completely ignores and bluntly, openly violatesthe law of the land, constitution of India and concerns of poor,tribals and environment ?""It would be opportune here tomention the main highlights of their letter written on 7 November 2013to Dr V. Rajagopalan, the Secretary, Ministry of Environment &Forests, Government of India, New Delhi - 110 003 seeking detailedenvironmental scrutiny of the project called ‘Statue of Unity’- World’s largest statue in theform of ‘Statue of Unity’ is being built near Sardar Sarovar Dam in theriver downstream from the dam, just 3.2 km from the ShoolpaneshwarSanctuary, in eco-sensitive zone and involving massive infrastructure.It has started work without legally mandatory environment clearance,environment and social impact assessment or any public consultationprocess.- It is clearly illegal, inviolation of the Environment Protection Act, 1986 and EIA notificationof September 2006 and a number of NGT and Court orders about suchmassive kind of construction on the riverbed. On 31 October 2013, thefoundation stone was laid for the project amidst huge fanfare and mediaattention. Tenders have also been floated. Even the work for theGarudeshwar weir, proposed about 12 km downstream of the Sardar SarovarDam, began without any social or environmental impact assessment, publicconsultation and environmental clearance from the Environmental SubGroup (ESG) of Narmada Control Authority’s (NCA).- The estimated cost of the project is more than Rs. 2,500/- corersThe key issues that beg immediate scrutiny is as follows: (1) The project clearly needsenvironment clearance under the EIA notification of September 2006, buthas not applied for or obtained the clearance at any stage.(2) The ShoolpaneshwarSanctuary boundary is touching the Sardar Sarovar Reservoir (as a partof the Environmental Protection measures of the Sardar Sarovar Project,the earlier Dhumkal Sloth Bear Sanctuary was extended to meet thereservoir boundaries and is called Shoolpaneshwar Sanctuary.) Since thestatute is only 3.2 kms from the Sardar Sarovar Dam, it is certainlynear by Shoolpaneshwar Sanctuary.(3) The Project involvesconstruction in the river bed and proposed reservoir, close to sanctuaryin eco-sensitive zone, and hence will have serious impacts on theecology and environment. Hence, and EIA and EC is crucial.(4) The project will affect the downstream river, its biodiversity, people and livelihoods and other related aspects.(5) A comprehensiveassessment of the environmental and social impacts of the ‘Statue ofUnity’ and its contribution to the cumulative impact of all the projectsand activities in the area has not been done.(6) The project also needs public consultation, but none has happened so far.(7) During the constructionof the Sardar Sarovar dam due to hard rock digging, the seismic areaalready carries the burden of artificial activity in the bed rock andadded load in what is deemed geologically fault line area. Publicreports on geotechnical and geological studies on the proposed site haveraised issues of structural stability as well as safety. This cannot betaken casually by authorities. The seismic hazard analysis claimed tohave been done by the Gujarat Government’s in-house “Institute ofSeismological Research” (http://www.statueofunity.in/execution.html#sthash.jEBrofSN.dpuf)or the Geological and Geotechnical investigation commissioned toanother government institute WAPCOS cannot be considered credible unlesspeer reviewed and put in public domain. Signed by around fourty leading scholars, activists - mainly from Gujarat - the said letter put forward the following demands : 1. Direct the Government ofGujarat to submit application for environment clearance and till that isobtained, not to do any work related to the project.2. Direct the Government ofGujarat to immediately stop planned project called ‘Statue of Unity’ anddirect them to stop all other activities related to the ‘Statue ofUnity’.3. Declare the action – ofthe foundation stone installation on 31 October 2013 for the projectcalled ‘Statue of Unity’ - of the Chief Minister of Gujarat State asillegal, in violation of the EIA notification of September 2006 and theEnvironment Protection Act, 1986. IIIAnybody can note the contrasthow the same media had gone hammer and tongs against Ms Mayawati for herpenchant for building statues of stalwarts of dalit liberation when shehappened to be Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh. All the wise mensitting at the desk of the newspapers and the TV studios told/advisedher time and again that the money could have been spent, on layingroads, building schools and hospitals, and generating power — allsectors where Uttar Pradesh lagged the national average. Apart from thefact that she was made a butt of joke for inaugurating her own statue,learned experts kept harping on the fact that it was just sheer wastageof money. For Mayawati’s detractors, the parks, and the statues inside,were nothing but 'unproductive assets, the indulgence of amegalomaniac.' No such advice seems to be forthcoming from all theseexperts to Narendra Modi over his pet project despite the fact that thehuman development indicators of Gujarat are no less better than that ofSubsaharan Africa.All its concerns towards thedispriviledged and the marginalised simply vanished despite the opensecret that the real agenda to have a grandiose memorial to Sardar Patelwas a desperate attempt by Narendra Modi to project him as the 'realheir' of Patel's legacy using hard earned public money - which involvesexpenditure which are more than five times the monies which were spentwhat one journalist had then called 'Mayawati's Statues of Liberty' (http://www.business-standard.com/article/beyond-business/mayawati-s-statues-of-liberty-111110500008_1.html).Everybody knows that Narendra Modi happens to be the third claimant toSardar's legacy within the wider Hindutva fraternity. If L. K. Advani,as home minister of India during the NDA regime tried to project him asthe real 'heir apparent' of Patel, Keshubhai Patel, erstwhile chiefminister of Gujarat whom Modi had replaced had also claimed for himselfthe honorific 'Chote Sardar'.Could it be interpreted asupper caste dominated media's inherent derision towards dalits andbahujans scripting an alternatve view of history and their growingassertion and its cosying up to an essential Manuwadi agenda peddled bythe Sangh Parivar and its lead mascot.",Statue of Unity: How The Varna Media Is Loving It !,Post-Construction
"The usual carping by opposition parties over anything the Narendra Modi government does, does not take anything away from the gigantic engineering achievementthat the 182-metre Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel statue in Gujarat embodies.Nearly twice as tall as New York’s Statue of Liberty, the statue,inaugurated today (31 October) by the Prime Minister, is something forthe nation to be proud of. And what matters is not the statue itself,but the shift in the nation’s mindset it represents.As the world’s tallest statue,which consumed over 2 lakh cubic metres of cement concrete, 25,000tonnes of structural and reinforcement steel, and 1,700 tonnes of bronzecladding, the statue was designed and completed in a record time of 46months – something few Indian projects can ever claim.

"Since the fencing, there have been fourcases of trespassing registered against villagers from Gora, Navagam andLimdi. Villagers argue that the government had acquired the land 59years ago for the construction of the dam, but was now planning to useit for commercial purposes and not for the dam, since the site hadchanged. Hence, they demand that SSNNL’s claim on the land should beinvalidated.The Kevadia colony is a Schedule V areawhere the provisions of the Panchayats (Extension to the ScheduledAreas), Act, 1996 (PESA) are in force, giving the rights of territorialintegrity to tribal panchayats who are decision makers in the process ofland acquisition. However, villagers allege that they had not beentaken into confidence in the government’s plan to transform Kevadia intoa tourist hub.The villagers also allege that themonetary compensation offered to them – Rs. 7.5 lakh per hectare (2.4acres) is way less than the current market value of the land – Rs. 35lakh per acre. However, the struggle still remains to be about retainingthe land rather than the compensation.PIL dismissed by Gujarat HCIn May this year, the Gujarat High Courtdismissed a 2019 public interest litigation (PIL) moved by activists onbehalf of the villagers and tribals of the six affected villages,reported IE. The PIL had challenged that while the state governmentacquired the land parcels in the five villages as long back as 1960,1961 and 1962, the villagers continued to be in possession of the landand cultivated there. Citing Section 24 (2) of the The Right to FairCompensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation andResettlement Act, 2013, it was submitted that if an acquired landremains unoccupied for five years, the acquisition lapses.However, the HC dismissed the PIL sayingit couldn’t be treated as one, because the right of possession beingclaimed was an individual right and it would be upon each individualresident of the said villages to independently and individually claimany right of compensation that was not paid and the state government nothaving taken possession of their land all these years, IE reported.The PIL had also raised the issue ofcompensation saying that though the state government claimed to haveawarded compensation, it had not been paid to the respective landowners.However, the HC held that the compensation offered and not received bythe claimant would amount to compensation being paid as the State hadspecifically stated on oath and has also filed documents to show thatcompensation was not only deposited in the Treasury, but also receivedby the claimants.To understand the situation on ground,Sabrang India spoke to Rohit Prajapati of the Paryavaran Suraksha Samitiand environmentalist Lakhan Musafir.Earlier, in an article carried bySabrang India, Rohit Prajapati had spoken about how the activitiesaround the SoU did not take cognisance of 1) The Wildlife (Protection)Act 1972; (2) The Environmental Impact Assessment Notification 2006; (3)The Environment (Protection) Act 1986; (4) The Wetlands (Conservationand Management) Rules 2010; (5) The Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016;(6) The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974; (7) TheRight to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition,Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, and (8) The Street Vendors(Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014.Now, speaking to SabrangIndia, RohitPrajapati said, “The land was not taken up or compensated for after theconstruction of the dam, thus people wanted to retain their own land. Ifyou look towards the right side of the SoU, there are 70 villages whichthe government is planning to develop. If you stand on the highestpoint, you can see two dams – the Sardar Sarovar Dam and the Karjan Dam.You can see the water and the river, but these people have no access towater. If the water can travel to Rajasthan, why can it travel to theones staying next to it? There is a drinking water problem here too. Youwant to irrigate the land of Saurashtra and Kutch, but there will be notalk about the tribals. Now the government doesn’t want the crocodilestoo. The tribals and crocodiles never had a problem living next to eachother. They had a good MoU. Now the government is looking for a wateraerodrome. Instead of tackling the Covid-19 pandemic, the government isfocusing on everything else. Why does the government want to throw thetribals out?”In an article carried by Counterview,Prajapati had pointed out, “A serious concern which has been disregardedis that the project site is located on an active tectonic plate in afault line area which is already burdened with the load of the SardarSarovar Dam and its massive reservoir. The construction of the tourismproject and other human activities after the completion of the projectis bound to have adverse effects on the downstream river, itsbiodiversity, and the surrounding wetlands all of which has been ignoredby the Gujarat government.” However, a petition regarding this whichwas filed by the National Green Tribunal was dismissed by it on groundsof limitation as the petitioners had approached the tribunal in March2015, six months after the Gujarat government handed over the work orderto L&T.Summing up the issue in a philosophicalmanner, he added, “If I have two kidneys and you ask me for one, Iunderstand. But if I have only one and you want it, you’re murderingme.”Lakhan Musafir, told SabrangIndia, “Theproblem is that in 1961 – 62, land of six villages was acquired for theSardar Sarovar Dam. However, because the height of the dam wasincreased, the land was not used. However, the government thought thatthe land could be used for a colony and built one in Gora and Kevadia.The rest of the land remained with the people and residents never tookthe compensation for it. However, there was a dispute regarding this asthe State government said that we had deposited the money in theTreasury. However, as the land remained unused, the tribals continued tocultivate the fields. When Medha Patkar began the Narmada BachaoAndolan, the people of these six villages also joined the fight arguingthat they too had been displaced from their land, but the governmentdidn’t consider it as their lands had not been submerged. In this way,the fight continued through the years. This year, the Gujarat HCdismissed the PIL so now the SSNNL have aggressively started fencing theland.”He added, “People don’t want to leavetheir land. Though the government says that it will offer land from itsland bank or offer compensation, the people don’t want to leave theirland. In the court, the state government had said that all the villageswould be rehabilitated in one place, but the people don’t wish to leavetheir village. We had filed an RTI regarding the claim the stategovernment had made saying it had deposited the compensation amount withthe treasury, but there was no mention about this in the reply. We hadinformed the Gujarat HC about the same too and we doubt that thegovernment had deposited the amount in the first place.”Lakhan Musafir says that the main demandof the villagers is that they don’t want to give up the little landthey have left. He said, “The Adivasi people like to live together.Their culture is here. They are being harassed. The police have set up acamp to keep a vigil on the villagers. We feel like we’re in Kashmir.The people of Gujarat are not getting any benefit from these projects.The environment is also set to get damaged with the influx of tourists.However, till today, that hasn’t happened. In these six villages, atleast 6,000 people have been affected. Promised jobs have not been givento them. The people in these villages are not getting water for theirown fields. We didn’t take the pittance offered in 1992 and we haven’ttaken it now because we don’t want to leave our lands. The Adivasis are asimple people. We just want our promised water. We’ve been fighting fora long time and we’ve been arrested so many times for raising ourvoices. We request the government to heed our pleas.”The struggle for their land by theAdivasis goes to show that the movement isn’t centered aroundcompensation or against development. It is centered on sustainabledevelopment. The tribals do not want to lose their identity in the nameof development and the least the government can do for those it hasalready displaced is, give them the benefits they deserve.",Gujarat tribals protest land grab around Statue of Unity,Post-Construction

"Depicted as a tribute to Indian structuring capacities, the Statue of Unity portraying the 182 meters height infamous figure of Iron Man of India, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel,is arranged in Narmada District of Gujarat at a stream Island facingthe Narmada Dam. It is the tallest model on earth and is on differentoccasions the height of Statue of Liberty, New York (USA). The figurewas unveiled on October 31, 2018, by the good Prime Minister of India,Shri Narendra Modi. History of Statue of Unity : Statue of Unity adventure was first given an account of 7 October2010 The Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust (SVPRET) was setup by the Gujarat government for the advancement of the model. Statue ofUnity Movement – a drive was started to help the advancement of thefigure. The Movement helped in get-together the iron required for theimprovement of the figure. Indian farmers were drawn closer to givetheir used developing instruments The improvement helped in socialoccasion 5,000 tons of iron. Despite the way that itwas from the outset gotten ready for the model, it was later reasonedthat the accumulated iron would prefer to be used for various bits ofthe endeavor The Statue of Unity Movement sifted through a Suraaj(“extraordinary organization”) demand. The solicitation was set apart byaround 20 million people and was named as the world’s greatestintrigue. A significant distance race ‘Run For Unity’ was held tight 15December 2013 out of a couple of spots every through Indium +-Statue’sFoundation stone was laid by Narendra Modi, the then serving ChiefMinister of Gujarat on 31 October 2013, the 138th Birth Anniversary ofSardar Patel.

The Statue of Unity milestone and its ecologicalvariables include numerous hectares (4.9 areas of land) an area. It issurrounded by a 12 sq km counterfeit lake. The Statue of Unity wasworked by Larsen and Toubro (L&T), who got the advancement contract for 2,989 croresfor the structure, improvement, and backing in October 2014. Theadvancement of the undertaking was started on 31 October 2014 andcompleted in mid-October 2018. The Statue of Unity was arranged by Indian craftsman Ram V Sutar. TheStatue was dedicated to Nation by Indian Prime Minister Shri NarendraBhai Modi on October 31, 2018, on the 143rd Birth Anniversary of SardarPatel. The figure depended on a Public-Private Partnership model. The Government of India had assigned ₹3 billion (US$42 million) for the errand in the monetary arrangement from 2012 to 2016. Not a waste of money: Statue of Unity, the world’s most raised model isn’t only atribute to the Iron Man of India, yet moreover is the primary suchexcursion spot arranged in Quite some time and is named ‘Pride of Nation’.Asentiment of vitality and joined India is blended inside the hearts ofthe people who visit the Statue of Unity or even have a short gander atit.With the construction of this statue, a lot of employmentwas generated, which specifically include construction workers, masons,and architects.The model is evaluated to remain everythingconsidered for quite a while. It induces that it will continue adding tothe national compensation of India through the movement business for 10centuries. This would help Gujarat to increase there presence in thetourism sector. The Statue of Unity will help in extending themovement of business pay and a tremendous district with Hotels,transport and various organizations will develop fast.Countless people in Narmada District and near to regions will get business opportunity clearly or in an indirect mannerIt is assessed that more than 10 Lakh voyagerswill visit the Statue of Unity reliably. This will help in makinggoliath compensation from the movement business and transportation andvarious organizations. Wastage of Money:  The appearance of 200 crores INR by theGovernment of India for the assignment pulled in the resentment of acouple of individuals and ideological gatherings. They rebuffed theutilization of the model over various needs like women’s prosperity,guidance, and agricultural plans.Other than the construction costs, this statue consumes daily maintenance costs of 43.8 crores INR annually,(12 lakh INR every day!) which a huge amount of money to chuck out fromthe government’s budget regardless of the situation of the economy.The tourism potential mentioned by the government will need a lot of time to be realized as the area needs to be developed in terms of roads, hotels, and transportation links from major cities. This price would add on to the previous prices.SocialActivists have negated the undertaking on the ground that instead ofsetting in the money in the creation of the figure, the money could havegone to address these issues of regular residents. Specifically, during the time of COVID-19 pandemic as well as Assam floods where common people are in adverse condition.   Conclusion: The construction of this huge structure has got enough of good thatportrays it as the pride of India and at the same time it consists of alot of bad that leads to wastage of money, but, now as its made andnothing can be done about it we should focus on the good parts and letit flourish for the betterment of the country and its people.",Statue of Unity- A sheer waste of money?,Post-Construction

Unveiled by PM Narendra Modion October 31, the 182-meter tall Statue in Narmada district of Gujarathas attracted around 1,08,247 visitors in just 10 days since itsopening doors. Talking about the revenue, it managed to earn a whoppingRs 2.1 crores till November 10. This information has been taken fromofficial media sources of Gujarat.Also Read: This Is How Much Money Facebook Earns Per UserIn the first 10 days, it attracted around 1.3 lakh tourists with an average of 13,000 tourists per day.After searching about the major sources of income, we came to knowthat tourists are brought from Kevadia, the nearest town by bus at aprice of Rs. 30 per passenger. The bus takes them to 9 spots includingthe statue. Apart from the SOU premises, all other destinationsincluding Sardar Sarovar Dam, Valley of Flowers are free for viewing.In statue premises, an adult has to pay Rs 350 and a Rs 200 has beenfixed for a child for full view. For those, wanting to visit only themuseum and the feet of the statue, the fee has been kept Rs 120 and Rs60 for an adult and child respectively.Talking about this, Principal Secretary (Tourism) S J Haider said:“More than 10,000 tourists had visited the statue on the very first dayof its opening. The number of tourists kept on increasing since November1.”He believes the new tourist attraction in Gujarat would help increasethe number of travelers visiting the state from other parts of thecountry and also abroad.“Gujarat has registered 17 percent year-on growth intourism with a total 5.2 crore tourists visiting the state in 2017. TheStatue of Unity will help in achieving considerable growth in thearrival of tourists to Gujarat,”he added.The statue has received comments questioning the government on thenecessity of the statue. A video made by YouTuber Dhruv Rathee on how itwould take almost a century to recover the cost incurred in setting upthe statue has created problems for the government. He also questionedModi government’s economic planning for having it at the banks of riverNarmada, for it will hardly attract any visitors and tourists there.",Here’s How Much ‘Statue of Unity’ Is Earning In Its Initial Days ,Post-Construction
"On Wednesday afternoon, long after Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled the 182-metre statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and left Kevadia in Gujarat’s Narmada district, the state police gradually released nearly 300 activists who had been detaineda day before the grand event. The activists – many of them Adivasifarmers – had planned to protest against the statue for which their landand farms had been taken over. The government responded by jailing themfor a day in police stations across the district and deploying an armyof special police forces for security at the inauguration.Withdissidents locked away, Modi unveiled the Rs 3,000-crore Statue of Unity– the tallest statue in the world – on freedom fighter VallabhbhaiPatel’s birth anniversary, declaring it a historical day for India. Atthe base of the statue, he also inaugurated a museum, an audio-visualgallery and a “Wall of Unity”, all aimed at create a new tourismhotspot. By 1 pm, the speeches were over and the dignitaries had left.AdvertisementBut for the Adivasi farmers who had been detained, the long-term impact of the grand statue cannot be wished away as easily.LakhanMusafir, an activist from Garudeshwar village whose house is 8 km awayfrom the statue, was among 24 other Adivasis detained for 20 hours inthe block’s Pipaliya police station. When Scroll.in spoke toMusafir after his release on Wednesday afternoon, he explained whyvillagers are angry. The statue, for them, is a colossal waste of publicmoney – a product of Modi’s personal desire for a lasting legacy –built at the cost of Adivasi rights.Water for tourism, not irrigationTheStatue of Unity in Kevadia has been built in the Narmada river, a fewkilometres downstream from the Sardar Sarovar Dam that has alreadydisplaced more than two lakh people in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat andMaharashtra. Kevadia and its surrounding villages in Narmada districtare a part of South Gujarat’s tribal or Adivasi belt, which stands tolose the most once the government completes the tourism zone it hasenvisioned in the stretch between the Sardar Sarovar Dam and the statue.Inthe tourism zone, farmlands and Adivasi homes will be replaced by a“valley of flowers”, a “Tent City”, guest houses for every state, hotelsand a boating lake. To make this possible, the government has almostcompleted the construction of a weir (a low dam across the river) atGarudeshwar, around 6 km from Kevadia. Once the weir is built, waterfrom the Sardar Sarovar Dam will be released to fill up a portion of theregion.Advertisement. Sixvillages near Garudeshwar have already lost land to the weir. Once theweir is complete, land in seven more villages on both sides of the riverwill be submerged.“These are villages that have been asking forNarmada canal water for irrigation for years,” said Lakhan Musafir. “Wehave always faced water problems and if the government really cared,they could have extended the canal to include all of our villages in thedam’s command area. But they have no political will to really give uswhat we need.”ActivistLakhan Musafir (centre) right after being released from policedetention on October 31. Photo courtesy: Michael MazgaonkarSubmerged without warningExperiencewith displacement has taught villagers of the region that thegovernment cannot be relied upon to provide commensurate compensation.In the 1990s, when 19 villages in Narmada district were displaced by theSardar Sarovar Dam project and officially recognised asproject-affected, villagers were given alternative plots of land. “Butthey were forced to disperse far away, in places that have still notbeen provided with basic water and other amenities,” said Musafir. “Formany farmers, their homes are now far away from their farms.”Theinsensitivity towards farmers was on display once again duringpreparations for the unveiling of the Statue of Unity on October 31. “Inorder to fill up water in the canal around the statue, the governmentreleased water from the dam without any warning to the villages nearGarudeshwar weir,” said Musafir. At least 30 farmers in two or threevillages lost their harvest, he said, all for the sake of picturesquephotos of the statue in the media. “Couldn’t the government at leasthave warned farmers about this in advance? If this is the case now, whatwill they do once the weir is completed? They want the whole areafilled up with water so they can do boating.”Advertisement Inaddition to land lost to the weir, six villages around Garudeshwar alsolost acres of land in last month when the government widened the accessroad leading to the Statue of Unity. When villagers protested thedemolishing of homes, shops and water pipelines in these villages lastweek, they were lathi-charged by the police. Displaced villagers, saidMusafir, have now been forced to settle in temporary homes a kilometreaway.People’s participationAsa witness to the suffering of fellow Adivasi farmers, Musafir does notmince words in his assessment of the new “tallest statue in the world”.“Thisproject has no benefit whatsoever for the people living here,” he said.“Even the little employment they are promising to give locals will beon a contract basis. The government is only concerned about tourismprofit, but shouldn’t a tourism project involve participation of thelocal people? Modi is doing this for himself, for his own immortality sothat he can tell people that he built the biggest statue in the world.And he is doing it for the big companies.”Musafir believes thegovernment would not have meted out such mistreatment to farmers andlocal villagers if they had not been Adivsai. “If this was Patidar landinstead of Adivasi land, they would not have dared to do this. But theythink that Adivasis will not speak, and that’s why we have beenprotesting,” he said.",‘Statue of Unity tourism zone will displace us from our lands’: Why Adivasis protested Modi event,Post-Construction
"The Statue of Unity is a colossal statueof Indian statesman and independence activist Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel,who was the first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister ofindependent India. He was the chief follower of Mahatma Gandhi duringthe non-violent Indian Independence movement.The construction of this monument wascompleted in mid-October 2018 and was inaugurated on October 31 2018.The total value of the project was calculated to be about ₹2,063 crores(equivalent to ₹25 billion or US$360 million in 2018) by the government.One of the monuments which attracted notpositive comments from the start but a pessimistic approach from theopposition as well as people concerning the cost spend on the same.Amidst economic crises, poverty status, rising hunger rate and manyother issues prevailing in India building such a statue which involved ahumongous amount only welcomed questioning from people.Is it worth spending Rs 2,063 crore on the Statue of Unity?While most of the people saw thenegative side of building a monument; there was yet another section ofsociety which supported. They questioned people as to why they don’t yousee that ₹2000 crore spent now will bring ten times more money infuture?Supporting their statement, theyexplained that with a height of 182 metres, it has become the talleststatue in the world, and would surely attract visitors across the globe.It is located near the Sardar Sarovar Dam on the river Narmada inKevadiya colony in Gujarat. Moreover, they believed that not only itwould improve the tourism industry of that state, but will result inbetter infrastructure, Jobs, Road, Rail and Air connectivity.They further added that money generatedfrom Entry ticket, Parking ticket, Bus ticket and many more source wouldresult in bringing revenue that will boost our economic growth.A year after building the Statue ofUnity, we can see that it has surpassed the footfall of the 133-year-oldStatue of Liberty in the US, with an average of over 15,000 touriststouring the monument on Gujarat daily. On weekend days the footfall isestimated to be around 22,000; While Statue Of Liberty attracts about10,000 visitors a day–a statement by Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd.Designed by Indian sculptor Ram V Sutar,the project was first announced back in 2010, and was finally unveiledby Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year. Sardar Sarovar Narmada NigamLtd stated that rise in footfall was after the addition of severaltourist attractions such as jungle safari, children’s nutrition park,cactus garden, butterfly garden, Ekta nursery, and many more alongsidemultiple budget accommodation options.If we go by the records, it is said thata total of 30,90,723 tourists have visited Kevadia till November 30this year, generating a cumulative income of Rs 85.57 crore.Within a year of the unveiling, if thestatue could generate such a massive amount of income, we can nowbelieve that it was not a waste to spend so much on a monument.",Was Building Statue Of Unity A Complete Waste Or Not?,Post-Construction
"Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, also known as the‘Iron Man of India’, a man who guided the integration of India bybringing 562 princely states together, and thus shaping the currentborders of India to large extent. A few days back, world’s talleststatue called Statue of Unitystanding at 182 ft was dedicated to this man for his exemplary work.Now, the question is whether it’s a moment of pride for every citizen ofthis great nation or a matter of concern?It is easy to recognise why it’s a proud moment for every Indian,with the statue being the tallest in the world, but I think it’s amatter of concern too – because of the huge amount invested in its construction.Let me tell you some interesting facts about our nation:1. As the name Statue of Unity suggests, apart from paying tribute toSardar Patel, the purpose of this statue is to tell the next generationabout the great sacrifice made by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and to bringa sense of togetherness among the people. However, is it possible toovercome the barrier of religion, caste, regional which are deeplyrooted in our society by constructing a statue of a man with such agreat virtue? Wouldn’t it have been better to introduce work done bySardar Patel and other freedom fighters in our schools’ anduniversities’ textbooks instead, so that every student could learn aboutthe sacrifices made by our freedom fighters?2. India is a nation with around 21.9% of its population living below the poverty line, 65 % of its population below the age of 35 years, and unemployment rate just above 3.5%.In a country like ours is it worth spending around 3000 crores upon astatue? No doubt it’s going to boost tourism to some extent and thusprovide employment opportunities, but to give a boost to tourism, wouldit not have been better to improve the law and order situation in ourcountry so that foreign tourists feel safe? Recently, India ranked 137th in the Global Peace Index making it one of the most unsafe countries in the world.3. Let us compare Statue of Unity with Taj Mahal. According to government data revenue collectedfrom Taj Mahal in the span of three years i.e. from 2013-16 was aroundRs 75 crore out of which Rs 11 crore were spent upon its maintenance andconservation. If Statue of Unity takes the position of Taj Mahal havingthe highest number of tourists in the year, even then it will takearound 100 years to recover the amount spent on its construction.4. Most of the developed nations spend above 2% of its GDP inresearch and development work. While India, which dreams of becomingsuperpower spends only 0.8% of its GDPin research and development. It is interesting to note that India wouldhave sent six MOM (Mars Orbiter Mission) in space with this muchamount. India, the world’s largest importerof military weapons can definitely reduce its import in the near futureif this much amount is invested in research and development.5. There are many other endeavours where this money can be properlyutilised, but due to the political ambition of a few, this huge amounthas been flushed.What if Sardar Patel would have been alive today? Would he feel proudof himself and his nation? Would he not have spent this much amount onsome other productive purposes?What was the point of our freedom fighters freeing our country fromthe clutches of the Britishers? Is this the country they dreamt of,where people will be divided on the basis of caste, religion, regionetc? Where it’s difficult for poor farmers, labourers to survive? Whereit’s difficult for a common man to get basic human necessities such asfood, clothes, healthcare and education?So, unless you speak against it, the hard earned money of thecitizens would be wasted in order to fulfil the political goals of a fewpoliticians.",Can India Really Afford To Spend 3000 Crore Over A Statue?,Post-Construction

Also known as The Statue of Unity, it isdedicated to the Indian nation as a tribute to its first Deputy PrimeMinister. The statue is built on an islet, Sadhu Bet, around 3.5kilometres downstream from the Sardar Sarovar dam in Gujarat’s Narmadadistrict. Apart from being the world’s tallest sculpture, the 182 metreStatue of Unity also holds the distinction of being among the fastest tobe completed in just 34 months. It devoured 210,000 cubic metres ofcement concrete, 18,500 tonnes of reinforced steel, 6,500 tonnes ofstructured steel, 1,700 tonnes of bronze and 1,850 tonnes of bronzecladding. Two structural concrete cores were used to anchor the Statue ofUnity, which supports the steel framework (cast from scrap which wassourced from all over India) attached to the 2,000 tons of exteriorbronze panelling. A viewing gallery has been constructed at 135 metres,at the chest level, from where 200 visitors can enjoy the breath-takingviews of the Narmada dam and other surrounding landmarks. Technical and Designing Complexities in the Erection of the World’s Tallest SculptureThe Statue of Unity was a mega project not just because of its giantsize & scale but also in terms of its geological complexities,extraordinary design and other unique challenges. Apart from on-timeproject completion and cost-effectiveness, there were several otheraspects that always kept the executing team on their toes. Designing the Mega Structure from a Photograph: Unlikeother projects, the design of this structure was multifaceted since thestructure had to be reconstructed as a magnified replica of a real-lifephotograph of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. This made it imperative for thedesigners and fabricators to make connections at every node.Stability of the World’s Tallest Statue: Ensuringthe balance of the 182 metre tall statue was one of the biggestchallenges, and that was further aggravated by its design of being in awalking pose with 6.5 metres gap between the two legs.Strong Wind Load Conditions: The statue had to beengineered to withstand wind speeds of almost 180 kilometres/hr. Thechallenge was not only of the wind blowing against the statue but alsothe suction effect it could create at the back of the statue. Both thesewind load aspects had to be considered in the structural design.Seismically Active Site: The location of the statuelies in an earthquake-prone zone. It was a daunting task for theengineers to prepare the structural design to survive earthquakesmeasuring up to 6.5 on the Richter scale, at a depth of 10 kilometreswithin a radius of 12 kilometres of the statue.A Viewing Gallery at 135 metres: It was an uphill task for the project team to build a viewing galleryto accommodate 200 visitors at the height of 135 metres from groundlevel.This massive project had multiple teams working simultaneously onvarious aspects utilizing different tools; therefore, accurate &complete exchange of information and smooth cooperation between everystakeholder was of utmost importance.

Among the dignitaries were Dhirubhai Patel,grandson of Sardar Patel's elder brother Somabhai Patel who welcomed theproject by saying, ""We are thankful to PM Modi and the government forthis recognition to Sardar Patel."" However, Patel said that he was not aware of any protests against the statue by local tribals.

"Vallabhbhai Patel, popularly known asSardar Patel, one of the founding fathers of India, was an eminentIndian politician serving as the very first Deputy Prime Minister ofIndia. He played a lead role in the country’s struggle for independenceand lead the nation’s integration into a united independent nation. Bornand raised in the countryside of Gujarat, he turned out to be asuccessful lawyer who subsequently organised peasants belonging toKheda, Borsad, and Bardoli in Gujrat during the non-violent CivilDisobedience against the British Raj. He ended up as one of the mostinfluential leaders in Gujarat. He rose to leadership of the IndianNational Congress and promoted the Quit India Movement. Sardar Patel isalso widely known as The Iron Man of India.On the 143rd birth anniversary of Patel, the now Prime Minister,Narendra Modi, inaugurated a statue towering up to 597 feet located inGujarat, the tallest statue in the world currently. According to thereports the statue is situated on an island- Sadhu Bet, about 3.2 kmaway from Narmada Dam and is twice as big as the Statue of Liberty, witha base of 58m and a bridge connecting the memorial to the mainland,with a visitor centre building, a memorial garden, a hotel and aconvention centre.The Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust was establishedwith the sole purpose of construction of the statue by the Gujaratgovernment. A load of efforts were poured into this project. Thisincluded initiating a Statue of Unity drive to gather support for theconstruction of the statue. This particular drive helped collect theiron that was needed for the construction by asking the farmers todonate their instruments. Iron amounting to 5000 tonnes was collected tobuild the statue but was later decided to be used for other parts ofthe project. The construction of the statue began on 31st of October2014. Larsen and Tourbo received a contract for 2989 crore for thedesign, for the construction and especially for the maintenance of thestatue. On Wednesday 31st of October 2018, the statue was shown to thepublic finally.What it all boils down to is to one pressing issue- was this statuereally required? The question that arises is whether this was a goodpublic investment or a monumental waste of public fund. India iscurrently on the verge of rolling into one of the deepest depressions,given the intense depreciation of the rupee against the dollar, andinflation may be right around the corner. Though the grandsons of Patelwere overwhelmed by the generous act by the government, what one isforced to wonder is whether this was in alignment with the largernation’s needs and necessities, especially in status quo. However, atthe same time it cannot be forgotten that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel didfight for having a united India, a united nation that had the abilityand capacity to make use of all the resources available to cherish andgrow.The presentation of this statue has caused a spur of crazy andconfusion nationwide. As usual hundreds of them took social media ingeneral, but especially Twitter to voice the things that they had tosay. Like always people filtered into two groups– the ones who thoughtit was a pride filled moment for India as it is the biggest statue andfelt it was an honorary statue erected in the name of Patel and otherswho held a firm picture of the sad reality surrounding us and what itmeant to dedicate so many funds simply to statue-building at a time likethis. The popular opinion amongst them all remained at the fact thatalmost 3000 crores worth of money could have been made use of on publicinfrastructure and to help the lower sections of the society.The government that heralds eradication of poverty in its policiesseems to have spent a whopping 3000 crores on a statue. Yet, whenapproached with issues like poverty, the sudden drop in rupee and thecrippled markets, the government seems to always claim the lack ofpublic funds available. The entire scenario brings us to the conclusionof questioning the efficiency of the system and examine how thegovernment manages to combat the criticisms directed at it",The Statue of Unity– A Good Move?,Post-Construction

"The Statue of Unity, the world’s tallest statue, is dedicated tovisionary Indian statesman Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. It was officiallyunveiled by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 31, 2018,amid much fanfare. Standing at a height of 182 meters (597 ft.), thebronze-clad statue is twice the height of the Statue of Liberty and 29meters taller than China’s Spring Temple Buddha, which previously heldthe title of the world’s tallest.Located in the state of Gujarat near the Sardar Sarovar Dam on theNarmada River, the Statue of Unity is designed by renowned Indiansculptor Ram V. Sutar and took five years to build. It features anaturalistic and historically accurate representation of SardarVallabhbhai Patel, donning characteristic garments and in a walkingstance.The late Indian leader, dubbed the “Iron Man of India”, played aleading role in the struggle for independence and guided India’sintegration into a united, independent nation. The local media describesthe Statue of Unity as an “architectural and engineering masterpiece”.Among the key attractions are a viewing gallery at the height of 153meters that offers breathtaking views of the Narmada dam and a museumfocusing on the life of Sardar Patel.During the day, the magnificent statue is a sight to behold and canbe seen from as far as seven kilometers away. As night falls, its façadebecomes the canvas of a fascinating projection mapping showcasedepicting Patel’s life and achievements. This amazing spectacle isaccomplished by Christie’s valued Indian partner Pyramid Technologiesand renowned German laser show producer HB-Laser using a total of 51Christie® Crimson WU25​ 3DLP® laser projectors. The team is responsiblefor the complete design, content creation and storyboarding, supply,installation, testing and commissioning of the Crimson projectors aswell as specialized lasers manufactured by HB-Laser to present aprofessional and engaging show. This is the largest ever deployment ofhigh-brightness projectors on a colossal statue anywhere in the world.Ajay Parwaney, Managing Director, Pyramid Technologies, said theteam’s ultimate goal is to create something unique and ground-breakingthat generates a big impact worldwide. The show has to be realized in away that supports the Statue of Unity’s massive appearance and includes abalanced mix of audiovisual elements that resonate with audiences todeliver a highly memorable experience.“We are honored to be involved in this monumental project from theconceptual stage during which we participated in a detailed projectionstudy that resulted in the Christie Crimson Series emerging as thepreferred choice of projectors for the projection mapping showcase,” henoted.Parwaney noted that the Crimson Series was selected for a number ofreasons, such as its IP5X-sealed solid-state laser light source in arugged and compact chassis and its ability to provide years of reliableand virtually maintenance-free operation. He added, “Thesespecifications are important to the client as the required projectionsystems need to withstand inclement weather conditions. On top of that,the availability of the longest throw lens that can project bright andvivid images on this 182-meter high statue was another major reason whythe Christie Crimson clinched the job for this project.”Complementing the projection mapping showcase is a mesmerizing laserdisplay executed by HB-Laser, which has almost 30 years of experience inlaser show, multimedia and video mapping projects. Harold Bohlinger,managing director, HB-Laser, said, “We’re honored and delighted tocelebrate the life and achievements of Sardar Patel through the designand commissioning of an exciting laser light show on the Statue of Unityusing the Christie Crimson projectors. By combining and synchronizingthe various multimedia elements together, we are able to tell theinspiring life story of the visionary Indian leader in an engagingmanner, whilst delivering a massive multisensory impact to spectators.”A huge undertakingAarti Parwaney, Director, Pyramid Technologies, recalled thatfollowing the finishing touches made to the statue, the actualinstallation process of the projectors on-site was accomplished in arecord time of 10 days. This included the construction of temperatureand humidity-controlled equipment housing, air-conditioning andelectrical works.All 51 Crimson WU25 projectors used for the 30-minute light and soundshow are housed in a customized IP65 weather-proof,temperature-stabilized enclosure at 20°C to 25°C to suit the enormity ofthe application and fitted in a projection room located about 600meters away from the monument. Specialized mirror mechanisms enable theCrimson projectors to display colorful visuals on the statue from such afar throw distance.“The enclosure was built at a height of 51 meters from the river bedand the finished floor level for viewing was to be at 58 meters. Theprojection was to be done from seven meters below access levels and wedidn’t have direct access to carry the equipment to the projection roomenclosure below since that area was still under construction. Therefore,to move even a single projector or rack, we had to deploy telescopiccranes which made the transportation of equipment extremelychallenging,” said Aarti.Despite the challenges, the team from Pyramid Technologies andHB-Laser were able to work closely together to overcome the variousissues, ensuring that everything was completed in time for the officialinauguration by Prime Minister Modi.Aarti added, “All the hard work was worth it, as the show created alarger than life experience owing to the enormous size of the statuewhich provides the most unique canvas to the projection mappinginstallation. There are several factors that made this projectdifferent, including a long projection distance of over 600 meters, thedistinctive bronze metallic projection surface with a very low gain, andthe use of a specialized mirror assembly to produce the desiredprojection results.”A major attractionThe light and sound show has received rave reviews since its debut onOctober 31. Every evening, it attracts thousands of spectators eager tobe enthralled by dynamic visuals and colorful lasers as the life andtimes of Sardar Patel is retold on the statue’s façade. The show is nowamong the major attractions at the Statue of Unity.“When it comes to challenging projects in India, Christie has beenthe preferred choice for projection solutions due to its excellent trackrecord in terms of performance, reliability and service support. Thisproject is no exception. The Crimson projectors have lived up toChristie’s standards and we are very pleased with the decision to useChristie Crimsons for this install.

"Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has many sobriquets — freedom fighter, founding father of the Indian Republic, Iron Man of India, and the man who integrated India into a unified nation. He has a new moniker now — the man who fragmented the habitat of the mugger crocodiles. Or maybe, his successors who built Sardar’s statue — ostensibly of unity — are better claimants to the moniker. Collateral damage seems to be the least of concerns for the multi-level committee — comprising officials of the Civil Aviation Department, Airports Authority of India and Gujarat government — when it comes to issuing and following tall orders for promoting the world’s tallest statue. News has it that the Airports Authority of India and the Department of Civil Aviation had come up with a feasibility report about introducing a seaplane service in the period immediately preceding the public launch of the Statue of Unity. Would Sardar Patel have wanted the crocodiles rendered homeless for his statue? (Source: PTI) To make way for the seaplane service planned for the terminal to connect cities of Gujarat to the Sardar Patel statue site, the Gujarat Forest Department has started evacuating crocodiles from two ponds on the Sardar Sarovar Dam premises on the Narmada. Rendered homeless, crocodiles are shedding real tears There are two ponds close to the statue. The Panchmuli lake (pond no. 3) and the Khalvani Lake (pond no. 4) — known locally as the ‘Mugger Talav’ (crocodile pond), are the home to nearly 500 crocodiles. According to reports, as of last week, 15 crocodiles were lured into cages using fish as bait, removed from the pond and transported on the back of pick-up trucks. The final destination of the crocodiles was not decided even when they were removed from the pond. Reportedly, the crocodiles were in the custody of the Forest Department for about a week. Then, according to Dr K Sasi Kumar, Deputy Conservator of Forests, Narmada, after considering the possibility of releasing them in their “natural habitat”, it was decided to let them out into the reservoir of the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Dam. “We are rescuing the crocodiles from Ponds 3 and 4, which are close to the site. 10 teams of officials have been deployed for the same,” Kumar added. Suddenly homeless: They look fierce but these crocodiles are helpless in this situation. (Source: Wikimedia Commons) According to a top official of the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd (SSNNL), who spoke to the media on the condition of anonymity, “For many years now, the Forest Department has been releasing crocodiles into the reservoir of the dam, apart from the main canal, the Ajwa reservoir and other canals. This particular exercise involves hundreds of crocodiles. It may not be possible to release all into the reservoir in one go. They will have to be distributed in other places as well. It is most likely that a lot of these crocodiles could end up going back closer to the human habitats from where they were once rescued and brought to the Narmada.” The outcry Mugger crocodiles are also called marsh crocodiles. They lay eggs in the marshy banks of water bodies where they also dig burrows and retreat when the temperatures are too hot or too cold. Now, if the crocodiles are relocated to reservoirs (which have concrete banks at an incline), the females would not be able to climb out to lay eggs. Furthermore, as mentioned by the senior official, the Forest Department has already been releasing crocodiles into the reservoir of the dam. Now, with a sudden influx of crocodiles that are being relocated from this mugger talav, there would be a sudden increase in demand for prey, besides habitat degradation, owing to overpopulation. The mugger crocodiles (Crocodylus palustris) in the Narmada fall under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife Protection Act, which covers the most endangered species. Already extinct in Bhutan and Myanmar, these crocodiles are listed as ‘Vulnerable’ on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List since 1982. The Narmada — portrayed as a goddess — has a crocodile as her vahana (vehicle). If this is how we treat even our religious symbols, we need to collectively rethink our morals. The move has, quite expectedly, come under strong criticism from wildlife experts. Bittu Sahgal, editor of the wildlife magazine Sanctuary Asia, tweeted: Dr Jitendra Gavali, Director, Community Science Centre, Vadodara, called the transfer of reptiles in such large numbers for making a seaplane terminal “against the principles of the Wildlife Protection Act”. Warning that the crocodiles may be harmed, he pointed out that officials can’t even be sure of their exact number in the ponds. “Moreover releasing them into the dam reservoir would mean that the female crocodiles may not be able to nest if the slope of the dam is more than about 40 degrees. Crocodiles need space on land to nest and also to come out of the waters during winters… If the government has spent crores of rupees making the Statue of Unity, it should spend some more money to make an artificial pond for landing the seaplanes without disturbing the ecological balance and natural habitat of crocodiles,” he reportedly said. If Sardar would have been alive, he may have shed tears on the plight of these helpless and hapless muggers. And we are sure they wouldn’t have been crocodile tears. ","Not crocodile tears: Over 500 crocs to be rendered homeless at the Statue of Unity, so a sea plane can land",Post-Construction

He was called the ""Iron Man of India"", andwas often addressed as ""Sardar"" which means ""Chief"" or ""Leader"" in manylanguages of India.Vallabhbhai Patel already had a successful practice as a lawyer when hewas first inspired by the work and philosophy of Mahatma Gandhi. Patelsubsequently organised the peasants of Kheda, Borsad, and Bardoli inGujarat in a non-violent civil disobedience movement against oppressivepolicies imposed by the British Raj; in this role, he became one of themost influential leaders in Gujarat. He rose to the leadership of theIndian National Congress and was at the forefront of rebellions andpolitical events, organising the party for elections in 1934 and 1937,and promoting the Quit India movement.As the first Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of India, Patelorganised relief for refugees in Punjab and Delhi, and led efforts torestore peace across the nation.

It has a 3-star hotel, a shopping mall, aresearch centre, high-speed elevators which will take you to a height of400 feet from where you can get a panoramic view of the Narmada andSatpura-Vindhyachal hills. But what the statue won't be able to do isfeed almost the whole of India a meal and still be left with Rs 1181.08crore with which 16 lakh kids can be provided elementary education ingovernment schools for a year — that's what India could have done withthe total amount spent on the project, say people who are a hurdle onthe road to development.We spent Rs 2.989 crore to build the world's tallest statue torealise Sardar Patel's dream of making India an 'empowered, sensitive,and aware country'. This might be a smart investment and could generaterevenue that could later fund several welfare schemes. But that's all inthe future. Here's what we could have done with that sum instead, rightnow: A simple meal with pulses and carbohydrates, like rice, bread or maizewith seasonal vegetables and onions cooked in vegetable oil and localspices would cost around Rs 13.50 in India, according to a report by theUnited Nations, World Food Programme. It would take Rs 1,807.92 croreto feed the entire population of India (approximately 133.92 crore in2017) and that too would just be 60.5 per cent of Rs 2,989 crore. Wecould feed 82.4 per cent of India two such meals. The public sector has to spend around Rs 7,268.15 for the elementaryeducation of a student. Vallabhbhai Patel's statue could have paid for41.13 lakh kids' education.  An average IITian spends around Rs 2.7 lakhs per annum as tuition fees —Rs 10.8 lakhs for a four-year programme.
