Kalyan Jewellers,Borivali West ',"We had gone here because Kalyan Jewellers is a reputed brand. The service was good. They treat customers well. However the making charges are a bit exorbitant as it ranges from 20% to 30% of the gold value. Moreover the variety of rings were less than expected. Overall I would say good experience if you can ignore the high making charges. Making charges are too high even after 2 level discount. 3 star only for the 916 quality of the gold. Staff is ok..kalyan name value and product is good. Kerala no 1 jewellers why take this much of making charges.? Huge shop. Excellent service. Staff is very help and explained well whatever we asked in Jewellery designed. Also they help to choose the right and suitable jewellery. I had a gift voucher in name of my brother which clearly stated that it can be redeemed by person holding it. Also I told them that I had proof of identity of my brother. Still they didn't allow me to redeem the card the terms agreed between gyftr and Kalyan are attached for your reference.
 I was there for almost 1 hour but they didn't even ask me for water which any reasonable store would have offered.
 Please avoid going to store as they are not abiding by their own rules and also the rates are higher as compared to other vendor both in basic rate and the making charges. Also there are always better design options available in the market. Waste of time Went to the showroom on akshaya tritiya.
 Got ignored for about 10 mins
 The 1st sales man I spoke to was showing the rings as asked but wasn't really interested in showing everything they had. I literally had to ask him one by one to pull out the sets and show me.
 Luckily another sales person who was busy but he wrapped up a guest and then gave us attention and closed a sale. From variety of designs to offers and discounts to repairing old gold, they are good at all of it. And above all you can be 100% assured about the purity of gold. We can find variety of designs and the staff is very polite and helpful but the making charges are bit high... No option for negative stars or else this would be way down below, avoid at all cost. Check your gold is its Hallmarked. Ours didn't have any marking. Check your bill too, ours did not have correct weights mentioned. Why more better options in Borivali than these cheats Disappointed with Making charges.
 19% is too high for Bangles and Chains as they are mass produced.
 It's like buying 10grm gold and paying for 12.5 gms.
 NO More Kalyan for me. I disliked it just because I did not got discount as I expected. Usually I purchase silver ornament and I get discount accordingly but this tym I purchase gold necklace and they did not provided discount as expected . They charged 17-18k making charges just on purchase of 18.5 grms gold.",4,1787,7148,4.6,1329,6113.4,3.9,4590,17901
candere by kalyan jewellers,Malad West Dely ',"I had an amazing shopping experience with Candere. I ordered earrings for my mother's birthday. Received the product on time, thank you for delivering the beautiful earrings prior her birthday.
 I never purchased jewellery online before I was a bit concerned about the authenticity, but when I read the policy it was clearly mentioned that the product will be delivered along with hallmarking.
 When I received the product it was properly hallmarked and along with the online certificate.
 In nutshell the product, delivery time, packaging and support was nice. Highly Recommended!!! Order 1058170
 Absolutely worst ethics. It's been close to a month now and I'm chasing via calls and emails to get the refund processed. There are many things wrong with this team but below are the few that I've faced in recent times
 1. Very long delivered dates which almost makes you miss all the special occasions for which you're buying the product. Please plan everything 2 months in advance( excluding return/replacement timelines)
 2. No one in the internal teams are aware and able to tell of what happens in manufacturing which takes 20-25 days. You're just supposed to understand that product is in manufacturing process
 3. Returns are the most difficult part and takes ages to get processed. I've personally faced this issue 3 times and yet I kept making the same mistake of buying from them ( I've stopped now)
 4. They always provide the same answers that the request/order will be processed in few days but rest assured it'll take atleast a few weeks
 5. I never got the products checked from other shops but I can see many complaints in reviews regarding the actual weight of metal
 P.S. - i don't write many reviews but felt it's my duty to share it this time It’s a fraud website, they show a product & when you weigh the same product from a local jeweller it weighs half a value of that product. And if you return it & raise a refund request it takes them a month & that too they deduct money as per there comfort, really disappointed
 Never ever order from them! order no 1018425 I am writing this to acknowledge the efforts being put by Mr. Hardik Soni for my product ordering. He goes extra mile for me and make my ordering process smooth and brings deight and handles the issue very professionaly.
 Kudos to you Hardik !
 Thank you Candere for having customer centricity being the topmost priority. Initially I ordered one ring from candere.. they send me the ring with wrong size after 30 days.. I asked for refund, they said 10% deduction will be there.. they forced me took another product.. so I ordered one customised chain around 1.1 Lac… yesterday they send images to me.. but it’s looks like different than original.. I asked them, what should I do if it is different than original.. they again saying 10% deduction on total amount.. I said to them, send the chain along with u r trusted person/ trusted partner. Will check and pay the amount.. they didn’t accept fot either one.. very very worst experience.. my amount was blocked at their end.. very very worst Hardik Soni, helped me in placing the order on Akshay tritya day, was very professional, calm and patient while helping me. I was bit busy asked him to call back multiple times but without sny issue he was always available for help. Good Job Hardik and thanks a lot for awesome service that too even after your working hours were over. Looking forward too placing too many orders with ur help only. Thanks. 10/10 to u I have to give special thanks and recognition to Rita Shetty for her personal attention and support in resolving my bangle size issues. I'm very satisfied with the overall experience of shopping at Candere only thanks to her efforts and PR skills. I really had to share the online shopping experience the Candere team has given me which really has changed my opinion on it to the worse one than my friends has shared with me.
 -- My order was placed somewhere in November which has given me a delivery date of 3rd December and yet ended up to be delivered on 14th .
 -- While placing the order it was showing me that 2 gold coins to be delivered freely along with this order , however when i see the Cart it still showed me 3 orders ( 1 which I've ordered + 2 Free gold coins). In fact I have got delivered only the one I have ordered.
 -- I did tried reaching the Support team which is really patheatic as none of them answers the call and one fine day I guess my luck favoured in reaching them out yet ended up in vein as i have to hear them saying "" you haven't refreshed your page while placing the order "" and hence you haven't got the 2 free gold coins
 -- There is no updates given on timely manner in regards of the order placed.
 -- I can surely say this would be one of the worst experience I had as an online shopper
 Last but not least, I wish this experience shouldn't be happening with any of other customers atleast The brand Trust and the speach less costumer services which they offer , always Bound me to purchase again and again
 I would like to recommend Mr SAGAR SINGH, who helped, informed and guide me for my candere wallet amount for my last purchase, i am really thankful for efforts which he made and creating an unforgettable experience for the same. I wish him a good luck 🤞 The expected date of delivery was 9th March, however got delivered only on 25th March 2022. The Company does not bother to update on the exact date of delivery. An automated mail is sent which says delay but the expected date of delivery is shown as the original date .",4.5,2633,11848.5,0,0,0,0,0,0
My kalyan mini store,Andheri ',"Kalyan shines among all its competitors for its low gold price and making charges to customers. It provides options of jewellery collection which includes kundan, polki, wedding and uncut jewellery besides contemporary gold and diamond collection.
 They also have large collection of silver utensils, idols and jewellery.
 The store is 2 storey building and staff is good.
 They also offer attractive gold schemes to buy jewellery. We probably did not get a good experience since we went near to closing time. Multiple Sales people were attending yet others started packing the showcase from where we were selecting the jewellery. They have gold sets in higher bugets of 4 lakhs upwards else you need to mix n match necklaces and ear rings etc. Very large showroom. Staff are friendly. Slightly inside from the main link road. Have lots of different designs. Had a good experience overall. They have total 2 floor. 2nd floor is for platinum and diamond. Only one drawback is they don't have lift for going to 2nd floor which is very difficult for aged people. Very helpfull staff. Nice service., staff mahesh was very helpful, patient and guide me well. Thank you so much kalyan jewellers. Visited this place last month the place was little difficult to find as it was located in a bit remote type area, had reached there almost near closing time but the staff were very coordinating and helped in finding the right ornament with patience. Hi all. Visited Kalyan jewellers to exchange silver ornaments in lieu of coins held with me. The jeweller quoted Rs 1.04 per gram more than the price in Joyalukkas for 100%=pure silver but offered ornaments with 92% purity. Cheaters.
 When they tested my silver coins with nitric acid they said the quality is good.. However when they calculated the price of old silver coins - lo and behold.... Look at the strategy -
 1. They offered to buy at a price Rs 1.00 less per gram ie,. rs 1000/- per kg.
 2. They deducted 10 % By weight from the coins marked with 999 purity..
 3. They deducted 30% by weight of those silver coins which didn't have 999 marked but were declared pure after checking with nitric acid.
 4. They were charging 100 % making charge over and above the price of 100 % pure silver by weight but offered 92% purity.
 5. When objected to their calculation, the exchange value of old ornaments and coins was revised from 25 thousand to 28 thousand in 5 minutes..
 6. When told that neighbouring jeweller had valued the same for 32 thousand, the salesman assured to re-revise the exchange value..
 We left the shop at this attitude of looting..
 So Ladies and gentlemen, please be very careful and calculate yourself the details of exchange as Kalyan jewellers appear to be dishonest.
 .... They will take care of each and every customers who have come there for buying jewels. Nice collections. Discount available. Pleasant environment. Parking facilities available. Everything is well staff design ,collection is also awesome but, sales men forcing me to invest in monthly payments ( bhishi) i told him that I am not interested in this scheme, because they are not giving coin after finish scheme. Theyadvice us exchange your old jewelry or buy new jewelry add some cash. so m not happy with KJ Extremely Rude staff... They should train their staff first some manners before they are taught the basics of Jewellery... Went to buy a gift for my wife Bday, but the staff behaviour was extremely rude... Never ever visiting any Kalyan Jewellers store again... Visited for the first time.and loved the staff cos they celebrated my birthday getting a cake.abt the rates,who cares",4.3,298,1281.4,0,0,0,4.3,353,1517.9

Kalyan Jewellers,Delisle Road ',"FALSE PROMISES - Extremely poor service. Wanted to buy a bracelet of about 3L and they made me come 6 times with false promises and never gave the product which was advertised on their website and on their catalog. One of the worst experiences ever in premium shopping. Also I saw them haggling with every customer for the price. They had called me for paying an advance and then told me the product is not available not it can be made though it is still in their website. Liars and time wasters. DO NOT PURCHASE FROM KALYAN JEWELLERS, ESCPECIALLY THE LOWER PAREL OUTLET ASTHEY HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO KNOWLEDGE ABOUT JEWELLERY OR SIZES OR COST. I was attended by Harsh, first he tried to scam me with and overcharhed final bill. Upon arguing and asking for a justification they finalised with the amount I said they mentioned earlier. My misery doesnt end here. After calling me twice to the store to check my ring size which ideally should have been the correct size in the first time itself. They have delivered a completely wrong size to me which doesnt even fit. These are my wedding rings and I am left with suck a terrible experience after making multiple purchases at this outlet. DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING CUSTOMISED AS THEY WILL SCAM YOU. The staff is very helpful and polite. Service is good. Our experience both the times has been good. The collection is good and different from other peers and staff is also cordial. Purchased Gold ring... Happy customer Good deal the salesperson Mr pinto is attentive and very informative Humble staff, very Co operative. Not much variety though.

Kalyan Jewellers,Matunga ',"Kalyan is one of the famous and well established business group in the country. The shop is centrally located at a prime place in the city of Mumbai surrounded by temples and business activities. Shop can be easily located and have a lot of well mannered supporting staff. All kinds of jwellery, diamonds and other ornaments are available with many varieties and designs. However if you want to exchange the old ornaments, the procedure of melting and other related issues takes some time which could have been avoided. Staff Ravindran & Vipin were very helpful patient courteous and friendly and made our shopping experience really fun n happy!! Store Manager Anand was also very approachable n helpful. Overall superb experience which will make us keep coming here. Thanks to Kalyan team Amazing amazing staff. Very polite, very helpful. They have great knowledge about the product too.

Kalyan Jewellers,Rajawadi ',"Very good spacious 2 floored store with parking space available. Good collection of different variety of necklaces, bangles and chains. Social distancing maintained and all covid-19 related protocols followed. But annoying part is even though there are many sales executive, they seem to be working very slow most of the time. Staff is too much cooperative. They will guide u properly. The way of explanation will convince you to shop. Here u will get jewellery of 22Karat and below. The design are very good. Superb
 One stop shop
 I really loved it.
 They give you accurate knowledge abt gold and their PR is dam good. Kalyan jewellers show you some good but they charge with gst and making charges it's too high. on 50k product they almost charge 10-15k extra making charges what they charge it's really too high as per competitively others jewellers. Pathetic experience out and out. We called in advance asking if they have valet parking. They assured us they do. We reached and found they don't. A person from inside gestured to us we can park in the building, through the side gate. The gate was closed. I opened it, and we drove inside. The security guard came rushing from inside and shouted at us asking how we can open the gate! It was their job to do, we did it, and got shouted at for it! We still went in, were shown some designs, and wanted to see more as we didn't like those designs. A person came forth and said he will show us more. We waited for more than 20 mins and he was going around and didn't bother to show us more. The one who was showing us the designs, didn't show us any more either. Disgusted, we had to walk out. Horrible, unforgettable experience. I don't think we'll ever visit a Kalyan store ever again. Pathetic experience we reach there on 8.15 because of the traffic and the sales men said we have to close so come tomorrow when we request him that it's important we have to gift the jewelry to someone he started showing attitude to my mom even he say please go we have to close. The Thane branch is best from my opinion if you want politeness. Firstly they don't have manners to treat customers.....their goal is to just serve anything and try convince.....

Kalyan Jewellers,Thane ',"Perfect place to purchase Gold and Diamond jewellery... They have a fabulous collection for every ocassion..
 Our recent few purchases has given us lot of satisfaction and peace of mind due to their low rate and transparency.
 Above all, it's their wonderful team who makes your visit and buying experience even more enjoyable. Special thanks to Shakir, Deepak, Vrushali and few others, for making us feel special.
 I highly recommend this place to everyone. Amazing experience...great service by staff n they are so polite..n they have too many new style designs as compared with other branches.n yeah there exchange policy was great 👍 Variety of jewelleries are really good. Service is also good. They entertain us and help us to show their varities with discounts. Only they need to improve their bill payment service which is very slow and time consuming. Value for Money, good collection of jewellery. Brand - One can trust. Good place to visit for jewellery... Nice collection.. staff are very helpful and will guide you in selection based on your interest and requirement..overall experience was good... Location wise very convenient near to eastern express... One can easily locate the shop as it is at the junction and prominently placed.. Wow love to buy from this shop they treat like we are owner... If you buy from KJ after than in emergency they give best price of our jewellery... Nice shop. Good quality available in this shop We liked the experience of buying gold at Kalyan Jewellers. They explain everything about the purchase in order to maintain transparency in the dealings. I recommend them for a hassle free gold purchase. Service here is very good with decent staff . COVID norms followed properly.
 Availability of jewellery is problem sometimes. Very crowded on festival season.

Kalyan Jewellers,Vashi (Thane)',"Service above and beyond expectation. Went in to get granddaughters ears pierced. The individual who did the piercing, an aged gentleman, was very knowledgeable in terms of aftercare required to ensure the ears piercing did not get infection. He was very patient as after the first piercing my granddaughter was very hesitant to get the other ear pierced but he engaged with us and her till she was ready for the piercing in the other ear. He even let her try one of the necklaces when she asked for a unicorn necklace after her ears were pierced. Definitely recommend this place if you want to go for ear piercings for your little ones. Considering the piercing costed just 350rupees the service was a million dollar. Had a terrible experience with Kalyan jewellers vashi. The behavior of staff is totally rude when we went to exchange jewelry got from their own shop. When we go to purchase they behave good and was treating us like dirt . Should educate the staff on good behavior towards customers, Shall never buy from Kalyan again Loved my recent purchase, was happy with the quality of workmanship and the design options in gold and diamond jewellery. Excellent customer service.
 Had hassle free experience in exchanging old gold jewellery for new. One of the worst place i ever visit again delivering defected or returned ornaments and staff does not know where's defect and overall manager and staff are insisting that you should check before delivery. I suggest all to thoroughly check all the items with magnifing glass since the staff are liars. This place is near to vashi station almost 100 meters away from Raghuleela Mall. They have large collection of jwellery. The staff is very co-operative. It was a great experience buying from Kalyan Jewellers Vashi Extremely professional staff.
 Good hospitality, despite being overcrowded on days like Diwali and akshay tithi they manage it very well.
 The billing process needs a little improvement, they're bit slow.
 on such days they should divide new and existing customers to fasten the process because new customers require verification which is understood. Good gold collection. Silver collection not that great. Only limited silver items. Courteous and patient staff. Best place to exchange gold as not only do they have the x ray machine to check how many karat your gold is but will also melt it in front of you and exchange as per current rate. ""Great shopping center for all kinds of jewelry. People are helpful. Honestly dealing. Can check the purity of gold on spot and will evaluate cost. also can Exchange available. Certainly the best experience"". Very High Making Charges, compare to TBZ and Tanishq, Joyllukas is 50% less making chrges. Kalyan jewelers minimum making starting from 20% making charges of Gold
 Dont waste your momey like this type of Jewelers. The shop has many new Collection but... they charge too much for making charges ..",4,1720,6880,4.6,42,193.2,4,2933,11732
